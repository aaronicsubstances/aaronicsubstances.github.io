<div class="mt">JOB</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> There was a man in the country of Ausitis whose name was Job. He was a man of truth and integrity, just, pious, and who abstained from every thing that was evil.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> He had seven sons and three daughters; and his cattle were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred breeding asses.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> His attendants were numerous, and his works great in the country. He was also a man of illustrious birth, among the people of the east.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> Now his sons had a custom of meeting at each others houses, and making an entertainment, each on his day, taking along with them their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> And soon as the days of the entertainment were over, Job sent for, and purified them early the next morning, and offered sacrifices for them according to their numbers; a young bull for a sin offering for each of them; for Job said, Perhaps my children have in their mind conceived evil before God. In this manner therefore Job acted after every of those days.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> And it came to pass that on the same day, when lo! the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan also came with them;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> and the Lord said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan in reply said to the Lord, Having gone round the earth, and roved the whole of it under heaven, I am come here.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said to him, Hast thou harboured in thy mind any thing against my servant Job? For there is not like him on the earth, a man unblameable, true, pious, abstaining from every thing evil.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> And Satan in reply said before the Lord, Doth Job worship the Lord for nothing?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> Hast thou not made a hedge about all that he hath, abroad and at home, and about all that belong to him round about, and blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle on the earth?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> But put forth thine hand and touch all that he hath, he will indeed openly renounce thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord said to Satan, Behold all that he hath I deliver into thine hand; but himself thou must not touch. So Satan went out from the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> and after that, on the same day, when the sons and daughters of Job were drinking wine at their elder brother's house,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> lo! a messenger came to Job, and said to him, The oxen were ploughing and the asses feeding near them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> and the plunderers came and carried them off. Thy servants also they slew with the sword, and I alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> While he was yet speaking, another messenger came, and said to Job; Fire hath fallen from heaven and burned up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds likewise; and I, alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> While this one was still speaking, another messenger came and said to Job, The horsemen, having formed three bands against us, surrounded the camels and have carried them off, and slain thy servants with the sword; and I, alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&nbsp;</span> While he was still speaking, another messenger came, and said to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking at their eldest brother's,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&nbsp;</span> a great blast of wind came up suddenly from the wilderness, and took the four corners of the house, so that the house fell upon thy children, and they are dead, and I, alone having escaped, am come to tell thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&nbsp;</span> Upon this Job rising up rent his clothes, and shaved his head, and falling on the ground he worshipped</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&nbsp;</span> and said, Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall depart hence. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. As it pleased the Lord so hath it come to pass. Blessed be the name of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V22">22&nbsp;</span> In all these things which befel him, Job transgressed not against the Lord, nor imputed indiscretion to his God.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> Again on the day when the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan said before the Lord, Having traversed that under heaven, and roved through the whole of it, I am come here</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said to Satan, Thou hast therefore attended to my servant Job; that there is not of those on the earth a man like him, guiltless, true, unblameable, abstaining from all evil. Still he retaineth his innocence; so that thou hast ordered the destruction of his property, without accomplishing thy purpose.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> In reply to which Satan said to the Lord, Skin for skin. All that a man hath he will give for his life.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> Only put forth thy hand, and touch his bones and his flesh, he will indeed openly renounce thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord said to Satan, Behold I deliver him up to thee, only preserve his life.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Satan withdrew from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with foul ulcers from head to foot,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> so that he took a shell to scrape away the ichor, and sat down in an unclean place without the city.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> And much time having elapsed, his wife said to him, How long wilt thou persist saying, Behold I will wait yet a little longer, in hope and expectation of my deliverance? For behold the memorial of thee; those sons and daughters, whom I brought forth with pangs and sorrow, and for whom I toiled in vain, are vanished from the earth; and thou thyself sittest among the putrefaction of worms, all night long in the open air, while I am wandering about, or working for wages, from place to place and from house to house, wishing for the setting of the sun, that I may rest from the labours and sorrows I endure. Do but say something for the Lord and die.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> Whereupon he looking stedfastly at her said, Like one of the women without understanding hast thou spoken? If we have received good things at the hand of the Lord, shall we not bear up under afflictions? In all these things which befel him, Job transgressed not with his lips against God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> Now when his three friends heard of all the calamities which were come upon him, they came to him each from his own country, namely, Eliphaz the king of the Thaimanites, Baldad the sovereign of the Saucheans, and Sophar the king of the Minaians. Having made an appointment they came to him to comfort and take care of him,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> but seeing him at a distance they did not know him. Then raising their voices they wept aloud, and having rent each his robe and sprinkled themselves with dust,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> they sat down by him seven days and seven nights. And none of them spoke. For they saw that the stroke was grievous and very great.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V1">1&nbsp;</span> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> Perish the day in which I was born; and the night in which they said, It is a male!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> Let that night be darkness: let not the Lord from above regard it, nor splendour come upon it:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> but let darkness and the shadow of death cover it: upon it let there come a thick darkness. May the day be execrated!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> And as for that night, may a pitchy darkness sweep it away! May that never come into the days of the year; nor be numbered among the days of months.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V7">7&nbsp;</span> But as for that night, may it be sorrow, and may there never come upon it gladness or mirth!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> But let him curse it who curseth the day; him who is to attack the great sea monster.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V9">9&nbsp;</span> May the stars of that night be obscured in darkness: may it long for light but never reach it; nor see the rising of the morning star:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V10">10&nbsp;</span> because it shut not up the door of my mother's womb: for that would have removed sorrow from mine eyes:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V11">11&nbsp;</span> for why did I not end my days in the womb? Or when I came forth from the belly why did I not instantly perish?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V12">12&nbsp;</span> Why was I dandled upon the knees? And why have I sucked the breasts?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V13">13&nbsp;</span> I might now have lain still and been quiet; I might have gone to sleep and been at rest;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V14">14&nbsp;</span> with despots of the earth who gloried in their swords:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V15">15&nbsp;</span> or with chiefs who abounded in gold; who filled their houses with silver;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V16">16&nbsp;</span> or like an untimely birth sent forth from its mother's womb: or like infants which never saw the light.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V17">17&nbsp;</span> There the wicked have ceased to be a terror: there the weary have got rest for their body:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V18">18&nbsp;</span> and they of old who are assembled there together; have never heard the exactor's voice.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V19">19&nbsp;</span> Small and great are there on a level; the servant, with his dreaded lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V20">20&nbsp;</span> For why is light given to them in misery; or life to souls distressed with sorrow,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V21">21&nbsp;</span> who long for death but find it not; though they dig for it as for treasures;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V22">22&nbsp;</span> and would rejoice exceedingly if they should chance to find it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V23">23&nbsp;</span> For God hath shut up death from a man; to whom it would have been a repose.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V24">24&nbsp;</span> For my groaning cometh before my meat; and I pour forth tears, begirt with sorrow.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V25">25&nbsp;</span> For the terror, which I dreaded, is come upon me; and that, of which I was afraid, hath befallen me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V26">26&nbsp;</span> Did I not cultivate peace? was I not quiet? was I not at rest? Yet wrath is come upon me.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> Here Eliphaz the Thaimianite interrupting him, said,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> Should frequent replies be made to thee in distress? But o who can bear the vehemence of thy words?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> For if thou hast instructed many; and strengthened hands which were weak; and raised up with words them who were fainting;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> and given courage to knees which were strengthless:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> but now, when trouble hath come upon thee and touched thee, thou art impatient:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> is not either thy fear grounded on folly; or thy hope? And this calamity the effect of thy conduct?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> Recollect therefore. Who ever perished, being innocent? Or when were the righteous utterly destroyed?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V8">8&nbsp;</span> As I have seen men ploughing improper grounds: they who sow such places shall reap sorrows.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> By the decree of the Lord they shall perish; and by the blast of his ire be utterly consumed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V10">10&nbsp;</span> The strength of a lion and the roaring of a lioness and the boastful pride of dragons have been extinguished.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> The myrmekoleon hath perished for want of food: and young lions have forsaken each other.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V12">12&nbsp;</span> But had there been any truth in thy words; none of these evils would have happened to thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V13">13&nbsp;</span> Should not my ear receive unusual things coming from him? At a dreadful sound by night, when terror appalleth men,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V14">14&nbsp;</span> I was seized with a horror and trembling, which gave a violent shog to my bones.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V15">15&nbsp;</span> A wind indeed blew full in my face, and my hair stood erect and my flesh quivered.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V16">16&nbsp;</span> I started up, but could perceive nothing: I looked, but there was no form before my eyes. I only heard a sound and a voice, saying:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V17">17&nbsp;</span> What! can a mortal be pure before the Lord, or a man by his works be blameless?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V18">18&nbsp;</span> If in his servants he placeth not confidence, and in his angels perceiveth some blemish:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V19">19&nbsp;</span> how should he treat them who dwell in houses of clay, (of which clay we indeed are) but as worms?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V20">20&nbsp;</span> but from morning till noon: and they are no more.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V21">21&nbsp;</span> Because they could not help themselves they were destroyed. For he blowed on them and they withered: they perished because they had not wisdom.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V3">3&nbsp;</span> But these would outweigh the sand of the sea, though you seem to think my words too vehement:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V4">4&nbsp;</span> for the arrows of the Lord are in my body, the fury of which drinketh up my blood: when I attempt to speak they pierce me.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V18">18&nbsp;</span> Thus was I forsaken by all, and being undone, I became an outcast.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V21">21&nbsp;</span> just to see my wound and be terrified. But why?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V22">22&nbsp;</span> Have I asked anything of you, or do I crave any help from you?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V23">23&nbsp;</span> to save me from mine enemies; or deliver me out of the hand of the mighty?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V25">25&nbsp;</span> But my words, it seems, are devoid of truth, because I do not beg assistance from you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V26">26&nbsp;</span> Your reproof can neither stop my speaking, nor can I bear the tone of your oration:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V27">27&nbsp;</span> because, you not only fall upon the orphan, but also insult your friend.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V28">28&nbsp;</span> But now having looked you in the face I will not lie.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V29">29&nbsp;</span> Sit down I pray you, and let there be no more reproaches. Indeed you again meet a righteous man.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V3">3&nbsp;</span> For were it his pleasure to come to trial with him; he could not join issue to answer one charge of his in a thousand.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V4">4&nbsp;</span> For he is wise in heart and strong and great. Who is hardy enough to stand up against him</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V5">5&nbsp;</span> who maketh mountains old insensibly; who overturneth them in his anger;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V6">6&nbsp;</span> who shaketh the earth to its foundations, so that the pillars thereof totter;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V7">7&nbsp;</span> who commandeth the sun and it riseth not; and who sealeth up against the stars;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V8">8&nbsp;</span> who alone hath outspread the heaven; and who walketh on the sea as on a pavement;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V9">9&nbsp;</span> who is the maker of the Pleiads and Hesperus,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V10">10&nbsp;</span> and of Arcturus and the chambers of Notus; who doth things great and unsearchable; things glorious and wonderful not to be numbered?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V11">11&nbsp;</span> When he passed over me I did not see him. When he passed by me, I did not know how.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V12">12&nbsp;</span> If he dismiss who shall bring back? Or who shall say to him, What hast thou done?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V13">13&nbsp;</span> For he himself slighted anger; by him the monsters under heaven were bowed down.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V14">14&nbsp;</span> But if he will come to a trial with me, or will take cognisance of my affairs;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V15">15&nbsp;</span> (for if I be righteous will he not hearken to me; shall I not supplicate his decision?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V16">16&nbsp;</span> And if I call and he will not answer, I do not believe that he hath hearkened to my voice?)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V17">17&nbsp;</span> Let him not break me with a tempest. But he hath multiplied my wounds without cause.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V18">18&nbsp;</span> For he suffereth me not to take breath, and hath filled me with bitterness.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V19">19&nbsp;</span> For because he is strong, he prevaileth. Who then can withstand his decrees?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V20">20&nbsp;</span> For if I am righteous shall my mouth be wicked?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V21">21&nbsp;</span> And if I am blameless, shall I go away crouching? For if I have acted wickedly, I am not conscious to myself: Nevertheless my life is taken away.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V22">22&nbsp;</span> Say then, wrath destroyeth the great and powerful:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V23">23&nbsp;</span> that the wicked fall by an untimely death. But the righteous are laughed to scorn:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V24">24&nbsp;</span> for they have been delivered into the hands of the wicked. He covereth the faces of the judges of that wrath. If it is not he, who is it?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V25">25&nbsp;</span> Now my days are swifter than a courier. They are gone without being perceived.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V26">26&nbsp;</span> Is there any track left by ships in their passage? Or of an eagle flying in pursuit of its prey?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V27">27&nbsp;</span> Now if I say, Let me forget speaking, let me bow down my face and groan:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V28">28&nbsp;</span> I shudder in all my limbs; for I know that thou wilt not let me alone though innocent.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V29">29&nbsp;</span> Now since I am wicked, why have I not died?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V30">30&nbsp;</span> For though I have washed myself with snow, and purified myself with clean hands:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V31">31&nbsp;</span> thou hast so thoroughly plunged me in filth that my very robes abhor me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V32">32&nbsp;</span> For thou art not a man as I am, with whom I can contend; that we may come together to a trial.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V33">33&nbsp;</span> O that there were a mediator betwixt us; one to determine between and hear us both.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V34">34&nbsp;</span> Let him remove his rod from me; and let not the dread of him terrify me;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V35">35&nbsp;</span> Let me not be terrified, but speak, (for in that case I am not master of myself)</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V1">1&nbsp;</span> To this Job replied,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V2">2&nbsp;</span> You, forsooth, are men, and wisdom will die with you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V3">3&nbsp;</span> But I indeed have understanding as well as you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V4">4&nbsp;</span> For a just man and one irreprehensible hath been made a mocking stock.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V5">5&nbsp;</span> For it hath been ordered that for a time he shall fall beneath others: and that his houses shall be wasted by transgressors.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V6">6&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless let no wicked man indulge a confidence that he shall escape condemnation. Whoever provoke the Lord to anger shall not they also undergo a trial?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V7">7&nbsp;</span> But ask, I pray thee, the beasts of the field, if they could speak to thee; and the birds of the air, if they could tell thee;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V8">8&nbsp;</span> speak to the earth, if it could converse with thee; even the fishes of the sea can tell thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V9">9&nbsp;</span> Who then among all these doth not know that the hand of the Lord hath done these things?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V10">10&nbsp;</span> Is not the life of all living beings in his hand; and the breath of every man?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V11">11&nbsp;</span> The ear indeed discerneth words and the palate tasteth meats.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V12">12&nbsp;</span> By length of time wisdom is acquired, and by long life, experience.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V13">13&nbsp;</span> With him is wisdom and power; with him counsel and understanding.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V14">14&nbsp;</span> If he demolish who can rebuild? If he shut against men, who can open?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V15">15&nbsp;</span> If he withhold water he drieth the earth. And when he let it loose, he overthrew and destroyed it,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V16">16&nbsp;</span> With him is strength and power; with him knowledge and understanding.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V17">17&nbsp;</span> He hath led counsellors away captive. And confounded the judges of the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V18">18&nbsp;</span> It is he who settleth kings on thrones and girded their loins with a girdle;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V19">19&nbsp;</span> who sendeth priests into captivity and overthrew the sovereigns of the earth;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V22">22&nbsp;</span> who revealeth deep things from darkness; and hath brought to light the shades of death;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V23">23&nbsp;</span> who leadeth nations into error and destroyeth them; who prostrateth nations and conducteth them;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C12V24">24&nbsp;</span> who changeth the hearts of the rulers of a land and hath caused them to wander in a way which they knew not:</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C13V3">3&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless I would speak to the Lord; and argue before him, were it his pleasure.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V1">1&nbsp;</span> for he is mortal, short lived and full of disquiet:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V2">2&nbsp;</span> or like a flower which fell when in bloom. He glideth away indeed like a shadow and can make no stay.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V3">3&nbsp;</span> And is it not such a one thou hast called to account; and caused such a one to come to trial before thee?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V4">4&nbsp;</span> For who can be free from stain? Surely none.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V5">5&nbsp;</span> Whether the course of his life on earth be one day; or months be numbered out for him, he cometh to the term thou hast set, but cannot pass it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V6">6&nbsp;</span> Turn away from him, that he may take rest, and comfort his life like a hireling.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V7">7&nbsp;</span> For there is hope for a tree; for if lopped, it may sprout again, and the tender branch may not fail.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V11">11&nbsp;</span> For in a course of time a sea is spent; and a river when unsupplied is dried up:</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V13">13&nbsp;</span> O! that thou hadst kept me in the mansion of the dead; and hid me till thine indignation should cease: and that thou wouldst set me a time when thou wouldst remember me;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V14">14&nbsp;</span> (for though a man die he may be revived, after finishing the days of this life of his,) I would wait patiently, until I come again into existence.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V15">15&nbsp;</span> Then call and I will answer. But reject not the works of thy hands.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V16">16&nbsp;</span> Now thou hast numbered up my devices, and not one of my inadvertencies could escape thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V17">17&nbsp;</span> Thou hast sealed up mine iniquities in a bag; and set a mark on every transgression, which I inadvertently committed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V18">18&nbsp;</span> But not to mention that a falling mountain will continue its fall; even a rock may by force be removed from its place.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V19">19&nbsp;</span> Waters have worn stones smooth; and waters have washed away mounds of earth; and thou hast destroyed the patience of man.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V20">20&nbsp;</span> Thou hast brought him to an end, and he is gone: thou hast set thy face against him and dismissed him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V21">21&nbsp;</span> And though his children be multiplied, he knoweth it not: and if they become few in number, he doth not perceive it.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V34">34&nbsp;</span> For death is the testimonial of a wicked man: and a fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V35">35&nbsp;</span> He shall conceive sorrows and bring forth vanity, and his belly shall produce an illusion.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V3">3&nbsp;</span> you speak against me; without shame you fall upon me.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V6">6&nbsp;</span> Know then, That it is the Lord who hath terrified me, and raised his bulwark against me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V7">7&nbsp;</span> Behold I laugh at reproach; I will not speak; I will cry aloud, There is no judgment.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V8">8&nbsp;</span> I am fenced about and cannot get out. Before me he hath placed darkness.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V9">9&nbsp;</span> He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown from my head.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V10">10&nbsp;</span> He broke me on every side and I fled: and he hath cut down my hope like a tree.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V22">22&nbsp;</span> Why do you persecute me as the Lord doth, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V23">23&nbsp;</span> O that my words were written and recorded in a book forever!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V24">24&nbsp;</span> That they were engraven with a graver of iron on lead, or on rocks!</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C19V27">27&nbsp;</span> For from the Lord those things have been done to me, of which I alone am conscious; which mine eyes have seen, and no other; and which have all been done to me in my bosom.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V1">1&nbsp;</span> Upon this, Eliphaz the Thaimanite answered, and said,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V2">2&nbsp;</span> Is it not the Lord who teacheth wisdom and understanding?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V3">3&nbsp;</span> What! Is it any advantage to the Lord, if thou, in works, art irreprehensible? or any profit, that thou shouldst keep a straight course?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V4">4&nbsp;</span> Or will he, instituting a suit against thee, argue and come to a trial with thee?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V5">5&nbsp;</span> Is not thy wickedness great, and thy sins innumerable?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V6">6&nbsp;</span> Thou hast taken pledges of thy brethren for nought, and hast stripped the naked of their cloathing.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thou hast not given drink to the thirsty: but hast robbed the hungry of their morsel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V8">8&nbsp;</span> Thou hast respected the persons of some and settled them in the land;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V9">9&nbsp;</span> but hast sent widows away empty, and done injustice to orphans.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V10">10&nbsp;</span> Therefore snares have beset thee, and an unexpected war hath made thee shudder.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V11">11&nbsp;</span> The light hath become darkness to thee, and water hath overwhelmed thee when asleep.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V12">12&nbsp;</span> Doth not he who dwelleth on high, observe; but hath he humbled the haughty?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V13">13&nbsp;</span> Yes, thou hast said, How can the Almighty know? Can he judge in darkness?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V14">14&nbsp;</span> A cloud is his covering, so that he cannot be seen, though he traverse the circuit of heaven.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V15">15&nbsp;</span> Thou wilt not keep the ancient way, which righteous men trod,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V16">16&nbsp;</span> who were borne aloft, and whose foundations were the surgy stream. As for them</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V17">17&nbsp;</span> who said, What can the Lord do to us, or what can the Almighty bring upon us?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V18">18&nbsp;</span> (He, who had indeed filled their houses with good things, though the counsel of the wicked is far from him.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V19">19&nbsp;</span> When the righteous saw them, they smiled, and he who was blameless laughed them to scorn.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V20">20&nbsp;</span> Had not the whole of them disappeared, a fire would have consumed the residue.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V21">21&nbsp;</span> Become hardened now, if thou remainest; and shalt thou be rewarded with good things?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V22">22&nbsp;</span> Receive, I pray thee, from his mouth, the terms of deliverance, and lay up his words in thy heart.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V23">23&nbsp;</span> If thou wilt return and humble thyself before the Lord, having removed iniquity far from thy dwelling,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V24">24&nbsp;</span> thou shalt be placed on a mount, founded on a rock, and be like the rock of the torrent Sophir.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V25">25&nbsp;</span> Then will the Almighty be thy defence from enemies; and he will make thee pure as silver tried by fire.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V26">26&nbsp;</span> Then indeed thou shalt have confidence before the Lord; and mayst look up to heaven with cheerfulness.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V27">27&nbsp;</span> And when thou prayest to him, he will hearken to thee, and will enable thee to pay thy vows;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V28">28&nbsp;</span> and he will assign thee an habitation of righteousness, and light shall shine upon thy ways.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V29">29&nbsp;</span> Because thou hast humbled thyself, thou wilt say, Such a one was insolent; but he will save him whose eyes are lowly.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C22V30">30&nbsp;</span> He indeed will save the innocent. Save thyself therefore, with clean hands.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V1">1&nbsp;</span> In reply to this, Job said,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V2">2&nbsp;</span> I know very well, this trial is not in my disposal. And that his hand is made heavy by my groaning.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V3">3&nbsp;</span> But O that some person would let me know, that I might find him, and come to an issue;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V4">4&nbsp;</span> that I might order the trial of myself, and that he would stop my mouth with arguments</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V5">5&nbsp;</span> That I might know what remedies he will prescribe for me, and understand what he will announce to me!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V6">6&nbsp;</span> Though he may come against me with great majesty, he will not employ it in threatening me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V7">7&nbsp;</span> For truth and argument proceed from him; and he would bring my cause to an issue.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V8">8&nbsp;</span> For if I am to go first and am no more, how do I know what will be at the last?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V9">9&nbsp;</span> When he wrought on my left, I comprehended not; he may encompass my right and I not see.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V10">10&nbsp;</span> For he already knoweth my way and hath tried me like gold.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V11">11&nbsp;</span> And I will come out at his commands; for I have kept his ways, and will not turn aside from his commands,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V12">12&nbsp;</span> nor transgress in my bosom: indeed I have hid his words.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V13">13&nbsp;</span> But if he hath judged thus, who can gainsay him? For he hath done what was his pleasure.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V14">14&nbsp;</span> For this cause my shuddering is at him; and on being chastened, I thought of him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V15">15&nbsp;</span> For this cause I am to be awed at his presence; I am to meditate on and be in dread of him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V16">16&nbsp;</span> It is the Lord indeed who hath softened my heart. It is the Almighty who hath made me shudder.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C23V17">17&nbsp;</span> For I had no knowledge of darkness coming upon me; and he had hid from my view thick darkness before me.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V2">2&nbsp;</span> and the wicked transgressed all bounds; and ravaged both the flock and the shepherd?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V3">3&nbsp;</span> They have driven away the ass of the fatherless; and taken the widow's cow for a pledge.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V4">4&nbsp;</span> They have turned the weak out of the right way; and with one consent the meek of the land are hidden</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V5">5&nbsp;</span> and are gone away like asses in a field. They are sprung up above me in their own order. To one, bread is sweetened for his children;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V6">6&nbsp;</span> others have reaped before dawn a field not their own; exhausted of strength have Worked the vineyards of the wicked without wages and without food.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V7">7&nbsp;</span> They have caused many to sleep naked without covering; they have stripped them of clothing necessary for life.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V8">8&nbsp;</span> These are wet with the dew of the mountains: and having no shelter they cling to a rock.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V9">9&nbsp;</span> They have torn the orphan from the breast: and him who had fallen they have pressed down.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V10">10&nbsp;</span> They have by injustice caused some to be naked; and robbed the hungry of their morsel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V11">11&nbsp;</span> They have entrapped some unjustly in straits, and the path of justice they did not know.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V12">12&nbsp;</span> Some are expelled from the city and their own houses: and the soul of babes heave heavy groans.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V13">13&nbsp;</span> Now why hath he not called these to account while on earth? Though they did not acknowledge; though they did not know the way of justice; did they not still go on in their courses?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V14">14&nbsp;</span> And hath he who knew their works delivered them up to darkness? And will he be as a thief in the night?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V15">15&nbsp;</span> When the eye of the adulterer watched for darkness; saying, No eye shall discover me; when he having put a mask on his face</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V16">16&nbsp;</span> digged through houses in the dark: (during the day they had shut themselves up; they had no acquaintance with light)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V17">17&nbsp;</span> because the morning is to all these as the shadow of death; because the terror of the shadow of death should acknowledge them;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V18">18&nbsp;</span> is it swift on the face of the water? The portion of these on the earth should be cursed</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V19">19&nbsp;</span> and their plants exposed dry on the ground: for they plundered the sheaf of orphans.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V20">20&nbsp;</span> Now was such a one's sin brought to remembrance? Though he was dark as the darkness of night; retribution should be made for what he hath done: and every wicked man should be broken; like a tree which cannot be healed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V21">21&nbsp;</span> Because he did not treat the barren with tenderness, and had no compassion for a poor weak woman.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V22">22&nbsp;</span> But overthrew the helpless with wrath: therefore when he riseth he should have no security for his own life:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V23">23&nbsp;</span> when sick, he should have no hopes of recovery: but should perish by his disorder.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V24">24&nbsp;</span> As his exaltation afflicted many: he should wither like mallows by heat: or like an ear of corn which fell of itself from the stalk.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V4">4&nbsp;</span> when I was making my ways conspicuous; when God watched over my family;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V1">1&nbsp;</span> But now the meanest have me in derision: now, those undertake to admonish me; whose fathers I held in contempt: whom I did not think worthy the dogs of my flocks.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V2">2&nbsp;</span> What in deed was the strength of their hands to me? Destruction would have been lost upon them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V3">3&nbsp;</span> By reason of want and famine it was useless. Already they were fleeing ineffectually from distress and misery:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V4">4&nbsp;</span> they were crouding round the samphire on the sounding shore; and feeding on sea weeds as their food; despicable and contemned and in want of every thing good, they through extreme want were chewing even the roots of trees.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V5">5&nbsp;</span> Against me thieves have risen up,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V6">6&nbsp;</span> whose habitations were the clefts of rocks.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V8">8&nbsp;</span> A race of fools and despicable wretches, whose name and honour are extinguished from the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V9">9&nbsp;</span> But now I am become their song: and they have me for their by-word:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V10">10&nbsp;</span> and have abhorred me and stood at a distance: and have not spared to spit in my face.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V11">11&nbsp;</span> Because he opened his quiver and afflicted me: therefore they have cast off the restraint, which they were under at my presence.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V12">12&nbsp;</span> At the right of their brood they have taken their stand: they have stretched out their foot; and vindicated against me their destructive ways.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V13">13&nbsp;</span> My ways are destroyed; for I am stript of my robe. With his darts he hath pierced me;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V15">15&nbsp;</span> My sorrows roll back upon me. My hope is gone like a breath, and like a cloud, my safety.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V18">18&nbsp;</span> With great force he took hold of my garment; and girded me about like the collar of my vest.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V19">19&nbsp;</span> Thou hast accounted me as dirt: and my portion is in dust and ashes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V20">20&nbsp;</span> Though I have cried to thee, thou hearest me not: but they stood up and observed me;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V22">22&nbsp;</span> and placed me among sorrows; and cast me away far from safety.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V23">23&nbsp;</span> For I know that death will destroy me: for earth is the house for every mortal.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V24">24&nbsp;</span> For! how I wish that I might lay violent hands on myself; or beseech another to do this for me.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V1">1&nbsp;</span> Here Job closed his speech, and his three friends ceased from making further reply to him; for he was righteous in their sight.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V2">2&nbsp;</span> Then was kindled the wrath of Elius the son of Barachiel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, of the country of Ausitis. His wrath was kindled against Job to a high degree, because he had declared himself just before the Lord:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V3">3&nbsp;</span> And with the three friends he was very angry, because they were not able to answer Job's defence: though they had charged him with being wicked.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V4">4&nbsp;</span> Now Elius had waited to answer Job, because they were older than he.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V5">5&nbsp;</span> But when he saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he was fired with indignation;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V6">6&nbsp;</span> therefore Elius the son of Barachiel the Buzite taking up the argument, said, I indeed am young and you are old; therefore I kept silence and was afraid to give my opinion.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V7">7&nbsp;</span> For I said, Is it not age which speaketh? And by many years they have gained wisdom.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V8">8&nbsp;</span> But there is a spirit in mortals; and it is the inspiration of the Almighty which teacheth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V9">9&nbsp;</span> They who live longest are not the wisest, nor is the knowledge of judgment confined to the aged.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V10">10&nbsp;</span> Wherefore I said, Hear me, and I will tell you what I know.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V11">11&nbsp;</span> Listen attentive to my words, for I will speak in your hearing that you may examine them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V12">12&nbsp;</span> Even now I could wish to attend to you: but behold there is none who convicteth Job; none of you who refuteth his arguments:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V13">13&nbsp;</span> that you might not say, We the Lord's advocates have found wisdom.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V14">14&nbsp;</span> And you have left a man at liberty to use hereafter the same arguments.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V15">15&nbsp;</span> They were daunted. They answered not again. They have antiquated their own speeches.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V16">16&nbsp;</span> I waited patiently: for I had not spoken. Because they stopped and made no reply,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V17">17&nbsp;</span> therefore Elius interposing, saith, I will speak again,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V18">18&nbsp;</span> for I am full of words; for I am pained with a spirit within me;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V19">19&nbsp;</span> for I am like a vessel full of new wine, in fermentation, without vent; or like the labouring bellows of a smith.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V20">20&nbsp;</span> I will speak that I may have ease, by opening my lips.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V21">21&nbsp;</span> For I should not be awed by man: nor put to the blush because of a mortal.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V1">1&nbsp;</span> Now therefore, Job, hear thou my words, and listen attentively to my speech;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V2">2&nbsp;</span> for lo! I have opened my mouth, and my tongue hath begun to speak.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V3">3&nbsp;</span> My words shall proceed from a pure heart; and the sentiments of my lips shall be pure.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V4">4&nbsp;</span> It is the divine spirit, which made me, even the inspiration of the Almighty, which teacheth me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V5">5&nbsp;</span> If thou art able, give me an answer; come to trial, and let us stand face to face.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V6">6&nbsp;</span> Thou art formed out of clay, and so am I: we are both made of the same material.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V7">7&nbsp;</span> By the dread of me thou wilt not be terrified; nor will this hand of mine be heavy on thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V8">8&nbsp;</span> Now thou hast said in my hearing; I heard the sound of thy words: for thou saidst,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V9">9&nbsp;</span> I am pure, I have not sinned; I am irreprehensible, for I have not transgressed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V10">10&nbsp;</span> But he hath invented an accusation against me, and hath accounted me as an enemy.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V11">11&nbsp;</span> He hath put my foot in a clog, and watched all my ways.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V12">12&nbsp;</span> For how, dost thou say, I am righteous, yet he hath not hearkened to me. For He, who is over mortals, is eternal.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V13">13&nbsp;</span> And dost thou say, Why in my trial, hath he not hearkened to me on every matter?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V14">14&nbsp;</span> For the Lord may have spoken once, and again;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V15">15&nbsp;</span> In a dream, for instance, or in a nightly vision: As when a dread horror falleth on men, during their slumbers on a bed;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V16">16&nbsp;</span> then doth he open the understanding of men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V17">17&nbsp;</span> With such appearances of terror he frighted them, to turn man away from iniquity. Again he hath saved his body from a fall,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V18">18&nbsp;</span> and hath rescued his soul from death; and hath not suffered him to fall in battle.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V19">19&nbsp;</span> Again he hath rebuked him with sickness on a bed, and benumbed all his bones;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V20">20&nbsp;</span> so that he cannot take any nourishment, (though his soul longeth for food)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V21">21&nbsp;</span> until his flesh become rotten, and he can show his bones bare.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V22">22&nbsp;</span> When his soul hath come near to death, and his life near to the mansion of the dead,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V23">23&nbsp;</span> though there may be a thousand messengers of death, not one of them can mortally wound him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V24">24&nbsp;</span> If he determine in his heart to turn to the Lord, when he shall have shewn man his charge against him, and pointed out to him his folly, he will support him, that he may not fall to death,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V25">25&nbsp;</span> and renew his body like the plaistering on a wall, and will fill his bones with marrow; and make his flesh soft like that of an infant, and restore him to full strength among men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V26">26&nbsp;</span> And when he hath prayed to the Lord, and shall enjoy acceptable things, he will come with a cheerful countenance and with thanks: and render justice to men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V27">27&nbsp;</span> Then will such a man blame himself, and say, What I have done! He hath not chastened me, as my sins deserve!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V28">28&nbsp;</span> Save my soul, that it may not go to destruction, and let my life see light.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V29">29&nbsp;</span> Behold in these three ways the Almighty doth all these things with man.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V30">30&nbsp;</span> He hath indeed delivered my soul from death; that in light my life may praise him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V31">31&nbsp;</span> Listen attentively, Job, and hear me: keep silence that I may speak.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V32">32&nbsp;</span> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak; for I wish thee to be justified.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C33V33">33&nbsp;</span> If not: hearken to me: keep silence and I will teach thee.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V1">1&nbsp;</span> Then Elius proceeded and said,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V2">2&nbsp;</span> Hearken to me, ye wise men, and ye who have knowledge listen attentively.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V3">3&nbsp;</span> For the ear trieth words and the palate tasteth meats.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V4">4&nbsp;</span> Let us take upon us the right of judging: Let us know among ourselves what is good.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V5">5&nbsp;</span> For Job hath said, I am righteous: the Lord hath removed from me the trial;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V6">6&nbsp;</span> and hath disappointed me of my trial. My wound is grievous without transgression.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V7">7&nbsp;</span> What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V8">8&nbsp;</span> who hath neither sinned, nor been guilty of impiety; nor associated with the workers of iniquity to walk with impious men?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V9">9&nbsp;</span> For thou shouldst not say, There shall be no visitation of man. He shall indeed have a visitation from the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V10">10&nbsp;</span> Therefore hearken to me, ye who are wise in heart. Far be it from me to be profane before the Lord; or before the Almighty to disturb the course of justice.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V11">11&nbsp;</span> But he should render to every man according to each one's work; so that in his own paths every man may find him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V12">12&nbsp;</span> But dost thou think that the Lord will do improper things? Or will the Almighty who made the earth, pervert judgment?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V13">13&nbsp;</span> Now who is this maker of the world and of all the things therein?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V14">14&nbsp;</span> For were it his pleasure to confine, and keep to himself, the wind,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V15">15&nbsp;</span> all flesh would expire together; and every mortal would return to earth, of which they were formed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V16">16&nbsp;</span> See that thou be not chastened. Hear these things; listen attentively to the sound of words.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V17">17&nbsp;</span> Consider that he who hateth iniquity; and that he who destroyeth the wicked, being eternal, is just.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V18">18&nbsp;</span> He is irreverent, who saith to a king, Thou transgressest: to princes, you are acting impiously.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V19">19&nbsp;</span> Who hath no respect for the person of an honourable man; nor knoweth how to honour nobles by respecting their persons.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V20">20&nbsp;</span> But it should be in vain for them to cry or to entreat a man, for they behaved wickedly in turning aside the weak.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V21">21&nbsp;</span> For he is the observer of men's actions, and nothing that they do can escape his notice:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V22">22&nbsp;</span> nor can there be a place, where the workers of iniquity can be concealed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V23">23&nbsp;</span> That he will not yet set himself against a man;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V24">24&nbsp;</span> is because the Lord superintendeth all in ways unsearchable; glorious and wonderful, not to be numbered.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V25">25&nbsp;</span> As he knoweth their works: he should bring on night and they should be humbled.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V26">26&nbsp;</span> But hath he extinguished the wicked though they are visible before him?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V27">27&nbsp;</span> Because they turned aside from the law of God and did not acknowledge his judgments,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V28">28&nbsp;</span> when they cause the cry of the poor to ascend to him, he should hearken to the cry of the poor.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V29">29&nbsp;</span> But when he giveth rest, who shall call him to account? When he hideth his face, who can see him? Both against a nation, and against a man at the same time,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V30">30&nbsp;</span> he maketh a hypocritick man king; because of the perverseness of a people.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V31">31&nbsp;</span> Because one saith to the Almighty, I have taken, I will not again take a pledge:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V32">32&nbsp;</span> I will look beyond myself; do thou shew me: If I have done iniquity, I will do so no more.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V33">33&nbsp;</span> Will he for thee punish that iniquity? Because thou must deny; because thou must draw the conclusion, not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V34">34&nbsp;</span> For they who are wise in heart will say the same: and a wise man hath heard this word of mine.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V35">35&nbsp;</span> Job indeed hath not spoken with wisdom: his words are not with understanding.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V36">36&nbsp;</span> Therefore let Job learn and no more make reply like the foolish;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C34V37">37&nbsp;</span> that we may not add to our transgressions. For iniquity will be charged to our account; if we multiply speeches before the Lord.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V2">2&nbsp;</span> I know that thou canst do all things, and that with thee nothing is impossible.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V3">3&nbsp;</span> Who indeed can conceal counsel from thee? Though he forbeareth to speak, can he think to hide it from thee? But who will tell me those things which I did not know; those great and wonderful things which I did not understand.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V4">4&nbsp;</span> Hear me, O Lord, that I may speak. And let me ask, and do thou teach me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V5">5&nbsp;</span> I heard of thee before, with the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye hath seen thee,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V6">6&nbsp;</span> therefore I abhor myself, and am ready to drop into dissolution, and account myself as dust and ashes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V7">7&nbsp;</span> Now after the Lord had spoken all these things to Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz, the Thaimanite, Thou hast sinned and thy two friends. For you have not spoken any thing true before me, as my servant Job hath.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V8">8&nbsp;</span> Now therefore take seven young bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and he will make an offering for you; and my servant Job will pray for you. For him only I will accept; for were it not for his sake, I would destroy you, because you have not spoken what is true against my servant Job.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V9">9&nbsp;</span> So Eliphaz the Thaimanite, and Baldad the Sauchean, and Sophar the Minaian, went and did as the Lord commanded them, and he forgave them their sin for Job's sake.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V10">10&nbsp;</span> And the Lord increased Job. Upon his making supplication for his friends, the Lord forgave them their sins, and the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V11">11&nbsp;</span> When all his brethren and his sisters heard what had befallen him, they came to him, together with all those who were formerly acquainted with him, and having eaten and drank at his house, they comforted him, and expressed their amazement at all that the Lord had brought upon him. And every one presented him a lamb, and a quarter of a drachm of gold bullion.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V12">12&nbsp;</span> And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than the former; so that his stock was fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, a thousand breeding asses.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V13">13&nbsp;</span> And he had seven sons born to him, and three daughters, the eldest of whom he called Hemera, and the second Kasia,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V14">14&nbsp;</span> and the third Amalthaiakeres.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V15">15&nbsp;</span> And in all the land there were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V16">16&nbsp;</span> And Job lived after this affliction a hundred and seventy years. So that all the years which he lived were two hundred and forty. And Job saw his children and his children's children, to the fourth generation,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C42V17">17&nbsp;</span> and died an old man and full of days. And it is written that he will rise again with them whom the Lord raiseth up. This is translated out of a book in the Syrian language: For he dwelt in the land of Ausitis, on the confines of Idumea and Arabia. His first name was Jobab, and having married an Arabian woman, he had by her a son whose name was Ennon. Now he himself was a son of father Zare, one of the sons of Esau, and his mother's name was Bosorra: so that he was the fifth in descent from Abraham. Now these were the kings who reigned in Edom, over which country he also bore rule. The first was Balak, the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dannaba. And after Balak, Jobab, who is called Job; and after him, Asom who was general from the region of Thaimanitis; and after him, Adad, son of Barad, who smote Madiam in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Gethaim. And the friends who came to Job were Eliphaz, of the sons of Esau, the king of the Thaimanites; Baldad, the sovereign of the Saucheans, and Sophar, the king of the Minaians.</div>
