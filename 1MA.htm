They told him of their wars and exploits which they do amongst the Gauls, and how they conquered them, and forced them to pay tribute;  <span class="verse" id="C8V3">3&#160;</span>and what things they did in the land of Spain, that they might take control of the silver and gold mines which were there;  <span class="verse" id="C8V4">4&#160;</span>and how by their policy and persistence they conquered all the place (and the place was exceedingly far from them), and the kings who came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, until they had defeated them, and struck them severely; and how the rest give them tribute year by year.  <span class="verse" id="C8V5">5&#160;</span>Philip, and Perseus, king of Chittim, and those who lifted up themselves against them, they defeated in battle, and conquered them.  <span class="verse" id="C8V6">6&#160;</span>Antiochus also, the great king of Asia, came against them to battle, having one hundred and twenty elephants, with cavalry, chariots, and an exceedingly great army, and he was defeated by them.  <span class="verse" id="C8V7">7&#160;</span>They took him alive, and decreed that both he and those who reigned after him should give them a great tribute, and should give hostages, and a parcel of land from the best of their provinces:  <span class="verse" id="C8V8">8&#160;</span>the countries of India, Media, and Lydia. They took them from him, and gave them to King Eumenes.  <span class="verse" id="C8V9">9&#160;</span>Judas heard how the Greeks planned to come and destroy them,  <span class="verse" id="C8V10">10&#160;</span>but this became known to them, and they sent against them a general who fought against them, and many of them fell down wounded to death, and they made captive their wives and their children, and plundered them, and conquered their land, and pulled down their strongholds, and plundered them, and brought them into bondage to this day.  <span class="verse" id="C8V11">11&#160;</span>The remaining kingdoms and islands, as many as rose up against them at any time, they destroyed and made them to be their servants;  <span class="verse" id="C8V12">12&#160;</span>but with their friends and those who relied on them they stayed friends.

The bridegroom came out with his friends and his kindred to meet them with timbrels, musicians, and many weapons.  <span class="verse" id="C9V40">40&#160;</span>They rose up against them from their ambush and killed them, and many fell wounded to death. The remnant fled into the mountain, and the Jews took all their spoils.  <span class="verse" id="C9V41">41&#160;</span>So the wedding was turned into mourning, and the voice of their musicians into lamentation.  <span class="verse" id="C9V42">42&#160;</span>They avenged fully the blood of their brother, and turned back to the marshes of the Jordan. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C9V43">43&#160;</span>Bacchides heard it, and he came on the Sabbath day to the banks of Jordan with a great army.  <span class="verse" id="C9V44">44&#160;</span>Jonathan said to his company, “Let’s stand up now and fight for our lives, for things are different today than they were yesterday and the day before.  <span class="verse" id="C9V45">45&#160;</span>For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us.
