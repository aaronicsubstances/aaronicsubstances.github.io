<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> A word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Ozias and Joatham and Achaz and Ezekias kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas king of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea. When the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take thee a wife of whoredom, and children of whoredoms, since the land is going and will go a whoring from the Lord;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> He then went and took Gomer a daughter of Debelaim: and when she conceived and bore him a son,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Jehu, and cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> And when she conceived again and bore a daughter, he said to him, Call her name, Not compassionated; for I will no longer continue to have compassion on the house of Israel, but will set myself against them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> But on the children of Juda I will have compassion and I will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> And when she had weaned Not compassionated, she conceived again and bore a son,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> and he said, Call his name Not my people, since you are not my people and I am not your God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> (Now the number of the children of Israel was like the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor counted.) But it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, they shall be called children of the Living God,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> and the children of Juda and the children of Israel shall be gathered together and shall appoint for themselves one head and come up out of the land. Because great will be the day of Jezrael;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> say ye to your brother, My people, and to your sister, Compassionated;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> emplead your mother, emplead, because with regard to her, is she not my wife? And as for me, am not I her husband? Therefore I will remove her fornication from before me and her adultery from between her breasts.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> That I may do this I will strip her naked, and reduce her to the state she was in at her birth. I will indeed make her desolate, and order her to a land without water and kill her with thirst,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> and on her children I will not have compassion. Because they are children of fornication;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> because their mother hath committed whoredom; she, who brought them forth hath acted shamefully; because she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, and my apparel and my fine linens, mine oil and all things convenient for me;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> for this behold I will hedge up her way with thorns; and block up her ways that she may not find her path.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> Though she follow her lovers she shall not overtake them; though she seek them, she shall not find them. Then she will say, I will go and return to my former husband, for it was then better with me than now.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> She indeed did not acknowledge that I gave her the corn and wine and oil; and multiplied silver for her: but she made ornaments of gold and silver for Baal:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> therefore I will turn and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its appointed time; and I will take away my garments and my fine linens, that she may not cover her nakedness:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> and I will now disclose her impurity before her lovers; and none shall deliver her out of my hand.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> I will indeed turn away all her pleasures, her festivals, and her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn assemblies.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> And I will lay waste her vineyards and her fig orchards; all those things respecting which she said, these are my rewards which my lovers gave me; and I will make them for a memorial; and the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the air, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> And I will punish her for the days of the baleims in which she sacrificed to them. when she had put on her ear rings and her jewels, she went after her lovers and forgot me, saith the Lord;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V14">14&nbsp;</span> therefore behold I will cause her to wander, and order her to a wilderness and speak to her heart.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V15">15&nbsp;</span> And thence I will give her for her possessions, even the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be humbled there as in the days of her youth, even as in the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V16">16&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that she will call me My husband; and no more call me Baalim.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V17">17&nbsp;</span> I will indeed take away the names of the Baalims out of her mouth, and their names shall no more be mentioned.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V18">18&nbsp;</span> And in that day I will make a covenant for them, with the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the reptiles of the earth; and bow and sword and battle I will crush out of the land; and I will settle thee securely</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V19">19&nbsp;</span> and betroth thee to myself forever. I will indeed betroth thee to myself by righteousness and by judgment and by compassion and by tender mercies:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V20">20&nbsp;</span> and I will betroth thee to myself by fidelity; and thou shalt acknowledge the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V21">21&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will hearken to the heaven, and it shall hearken to the earth,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V22">22&nbsp;</span> and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil, and they shall hearken to Jezrael;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V23">23&nbsp;</span> and I will plant her for myself in the land, and love her who was not beloved; and to them who were not my people I will say, Thou art my people: and they will say, Thou the Lord art my God.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> Hear a word of the Lord, children of Israel! the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of this land; because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> Cursing and lying and murder and theft and adultery are burst out on the land, and blood mingleth with blood;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> therefore the land shall mourn and be wasted with all its inhabitants, with the wild beasts of the fields and with the reptiles of the earth, and with the birds of the air. Even the fishes of the sea shall fail.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> In order that none may be judged, that none may reprove, this people of mine shall be like a contradicted priest, (Jehovah. The prophet speaks.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> and shall be weak for years; and with thee the prophet shall be without strength. I have compared thy mother to the night:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> my people is like one that hath not knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, therefore I will reject thee from being my priest: as thou hast forgotten the law of thy God; I also will forget thy children.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> In proportion to their increase they sinned against me; I will turn their glory into shame.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V8">8&nbsp;</span> Shall they eat the sin offerings of my people and by their iniquities support their lives?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> It shall indeed be that as is the people so shall be the priest; I will punish them for their ways and retribute to him his devices.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V10">10&nbsp;</span> Though they eat they shall not be filled, they have committed fornications, and they cannot prosper. Because they forsook the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> to attend to fornication and wine, therefore the heart of my people embraced drunkenness.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V12">12&nbsp;</span> They consulted by symbols and gave them answers by their staves. By a spirit of fornication they were led astray; and they went a whoring from their God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V13">13&nbsp;</span> They sacrificed on the tops of the mountains, and on the hills they burned incense, under an oak and a beech and a shady tree, because shade is good. For this cause your daughters will commit whoredom and your wives adultery;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V14">14&nbsp;</span> and I will not punish your daughters, when they commit whoredom, nor your daughters in law when they commit adultery. Because they conversed with harlots and sacrificed with prostitutes, therefore my people, who were without understanding, were entangled with fornication.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V15">15&nbsp;</span> As for thee, Israel, continue not in ignorance; and thou Juda go not to Galgala. Either go not up to the house of On, or swear not by the living Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V16">16&nbsp;</span> Because Israel ran about madly like a heifer stung by a gad fly, the Lord will now feed them like a lamb in a roomy place.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V17">17&nbsp;</span> Ephraim associating with idols, laid stumbling blocks for himself.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V18">18&nbsp;</span> They addicted themselves to the Chananites; they went on in a continued course of whoredom; they loved dishonour because of its revelry;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V14">14&nbsp;</span> for I am like a panther to Ephraim, and like a lion to the house of Juda. When I tear, I will go and take and there shall be no deliverer.</div>
