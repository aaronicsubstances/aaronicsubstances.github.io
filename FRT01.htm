The Bible books here were gathered from public domain bibles available online. All the New Testament books and almost all the Old Testament books were obtained from the
<a href="https://eBible.org/eng-webbe/">World English Bible British Edition with Deuterocanon</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://worldenglish.bible/">World English Bible</a> project completed in 2020.
</div>
<div class="ip">
The Old Testament books marked with "LXX" (except for Psalms, Esther and Daniel) are those which are not from the World English Bible, but rather from an 1808 bible called <a href="https://www.obohu.cz/bible/index.php?k=Gn&amp;kap=1&amp;styl=THO">Holy Bible Containing The Old and New Covenant translated from the Greek</a> by Charles Thomson. Thomson's translation was based on a collection of Greek mansucripts for the Old Testament known as Septuagint (abbreviated as LXX).
</div>
<div class="ip">
The books titled "Esther (LXX)" and "Daniel (LXX)" are exactly the same as the books titled "Esther (Greek)" and "Daniel (Greek)" in the World English Bible.
</div>
<div class="ip">
The book titled "Psalms (LXX)" was obtained online from the work titled "The Holy Psalter", which is a translation of the book of Psalms in the Septuagint of the Orthodox Church of Greece into English, by one Archimandrite Lazarus Moore. That work can be downloaded as a PDF from <a href="fr__lazarus_moore_the_septuagint_psalms_in_english.pdf">here</a>.
</div>
<div class="ip"> The Old Testament books marked with "Tanakh" are exactly the same ones found in the World English Bible, and those books were not translated from the Septuagint but rather from Hebrew manuscripts. The "Tanakh" identifier is used to communicate their close association with Judaism, which refer to their Hebrew holy books as "Tanakh".</div>
<div class="ip">
The site owners prefer Old Testament translations based on the Greek Septuagint to those based on the Hebrew Tanakh. In contrast, The World English Bible follows the tradition of the King James Bible in the English-speaking world in basing its Old Testament translation on the Tanakh.
</div>
<div class="ip">However, the site owners currently do not have access to a public domain translation of the Septuagint in modern English. So they decided to select some but not all the Old Testament books from Thomson's translation. The selection was strategically made to include the Old Testament sections heavily quoted by Jesus and His first apostles.
</div>
<div class="ip">
As for reasons for prefering LXX to Tanakh, see online resources (such as this <a href="https://chasingalion.com/why-lxx/">one</a>) for details than can be listed here. To say the least to get started: almost all Old Tesatment quotations in the New Testament align more with the LXX than with the Tanakh. The LXX was also the Old Testament used by early Christians for the first 300 years. And the LXX is <em>still</em> the Old Testament used by Orthodox churches (ie churches other than the Roman Catholic Church or Protestant churches), and Orthodox churches happen to be the minority of churches in the English-speaking world.
