<div class="mt">OBADIAH</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God to Idumea, (I heard the report from the Lord. When he sent a message to the nations.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> Arise and let us go up against it to battle.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> Behold I have made thee very small among the nations: thou art dishonoured in a high degree. The pride of thy heart puffed thee up, dwelling in the clefts of rocks. (Having made his habitation high he said in his heart, Who can bring me down to the ground?)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> Though thou shouldst soar aloft like an eagle, and make thy nest among the stars; thence I will pull thee down, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> If thieves come to thee, or robbers by night; in what place soever thou mayst be cast; would they not steal what would satisfy them? And if grape gatherers came to thee, would they leave no gleaning?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> How Esau hath been searched! are even his hidden stores left?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> They have driven thee to the borders. All the men in league with thee, have risen up against thee. Thy men of peace prevailed against thee. They laid snares under thee. They have no understanding.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> In that day, saith the Lord, I will destroy wise men out of Idumea, and understanding out of the mount of Esau.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> And thy warriors from Thaiman shall be dismayed, that man may be removed from the mountain of Esau.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> On account of the impious slaughter of thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off forever.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> From the day that thou didst become an adversary, whenever the Philistines captivated his army, or strangers entered his gates and cast lots on Jerusalem, thou also wast as one of them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> But thou shouldst not have looked on thy brother's day in the day of strangers; nor rejoiced over the children of Juda, in the day of their destruction; nor shouldst thou have vaunted in the day of affliction;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> nor entered people's gates in the day of their distresses. Thou especially shouldst not have beheld their congregation in the day of their destruction, nor joined to fall on their army in the day of their defeat;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> nor beset the passes to cut off such of them as were escaping; nor shouldst thou have hemmed in his fugitives, in a calamitous day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> Because the day of the Lord, against all the nations is near; as thou hast done so shall it be done to thee: thy dealings shall be returned on thy head.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> For in the same manner as thou hast drunk on my holy mountain, all the nations shall be drunk up as wine. They shall be drunk up and swallowed down, and be as if they had never been.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> But on mount Sion shall be safety and a sanctuary; and the house of Jacob shall possess those who possessed them;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&nbsp;</span> and the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph, a flame; and the house of Esau shall be as stubble; and upon these they shall kindle and consume them, so that there shall not be a torch bearer to the house of Esau. For the Lord hath spoken.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&nbsp;</span> And they in Nageb shall inherit the mountain of Esau; and those in Sephale shall inherit the Philistines; and they shall possess mount Ephraim and the plain of Samaria and Benjamin and Galaaditis;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&nbsp;</span> and this shall be the dominion of the captivity; to the Israelites shall belong the land of the Chananites to Sarepta, and to the captives of Jerusalem, to Ephratha: they shall possess the cities of Nageb.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&nbsp;</span> And they who have been preserved, shall go up from mount Sion to execute vengeance on the mountain of Esau. And the kingdom shall be the Lord's.</div>
