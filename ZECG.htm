<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the Barachite, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> The Lord was very angry with your fathers,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> therefore thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Turn to me, saith the Lord of Hosts and4 I will turn to you saith the Lord of Hosts.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> And be not like your fathers to whom the former prophets called, saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Turn from your evil ways and from your wicked devices, but they hearkened not, nor gave attention to listen to me, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> As for your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, will they live forever?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> But receive ye my words and my statutes; all that I, by my spirit, give in charge to my servants the prophets, who reached your fathers, when they addressed them and said, As the Lord Almighty determined to deal with us according to our ways, and according to our devices, so hath he dealt with us.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> On the twenty fourth of the eleventh month, which is the month Sabat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the Barachite, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> (I had been viewing the night and lo! a man mounted on a red horse, and he stood between the shady mountains, and behind him were horses, red and ash coloured, and dappled and white.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> And I said, Lord what are these: and the angel who was talking with me said to me, I will shew thee what these are.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> Then the man who stood between the mountains, addressing me said, These are they whom the Lord sent to go round this land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> Then they addressed the angel of the Lord who stood between the mountains, and said. We have gone round all this land, and lo all the land is inhabited, and quiet.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> And the angel of the Lord, answered and said, O Lord Almighty, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which thou hast overlooked those seventy years?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> And the Lord Almighty answered the angel, who had been talking with me, with good determinations, and comfortable words.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> Whereupon the angel who had been talking with me said to me; He cried with a loud voice saying: Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I have been jealous of Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> and with great wrath I am angry with the nations who were set on. Because I was indeed a little displeased, but they were bent on mischief;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> therefore thus saith the Lord, I will turn to Jerusalem, with compassion and my house shall be rebuilded in it, saith the Lord Almighty, and a line shall be stretched on Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> And again the angel who had been talking with me, said to me; Again he cried with a loud voice and said, Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Again shall cities abound with prosperity. And again the Lord will compassionate Sion and make choice of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&nbsp;</span> Then I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo, four horns!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&nbsp;</span> and I said to the angel who was talking with me, Lord, what are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Juda and Israel and Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord shewed me four carpenters.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&nbsp;</span> And I said, What are these going to do? And he said, Those four horns which scattered Juda and Israel are broken, and not one of them hath raised a head; now these are come to sharpen for themselves those four horns, namely the nations which lifted up a horn against the land of the Lord, to scatter it.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> and I said to him, Whither art thou going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem to see how broad it is, and what is its length.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> Now behold the angel who had been talking with me had stopped; and another angel came out to meet him</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> and spoke to him saying, Run and speak to that young man and say, Jerusalem shall be crouded with inhabitants by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V1">1&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan stood at his right hand to oppose him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said to Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, Satan! even the Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee! lo! is not this like a brand snatched from fire?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord addressing them who stood before him, spoke, saying, Take away from him those filthy garments; (and to him he said, Behold I have taken away thy transgressions) and clothe ye him with a flowing robe</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> and put on his head a clean mitre. And when they had put a clean mitre on his head and clothed him, then the angel of the Lord stood up.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> Then the angel who talked with me turned and roused me, as when a man is roused from his sleep,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> and said to me, what dost thou see? And I said, I have looked and lo! a candlestick all of gold with the lamp dish on the top of it; and seven lamps on the top of it; and seven pipes, for the seven lamps on the top of it;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> and two olive trees over it, one on the right of its lamp dish and the other on its left.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> Then I inquired and spoke to the angel who was talking with me, and said, Lord what are these?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> And the angel who was talking with me, answered and said to me, Dost thou not know what these are? When I said, No, lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> Then he answered and said to me, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying, Not by mighty power nor by strength, but by my spirit? saith the Lord Almighty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> Who art thou; to complete this mountain; this great one; this before Zorobabel! I will indeed bring out the stone of the inheritance, an equality of favour, a free gift of it.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and thou shalt know, (since the Lord Almighty hath sent me to thee,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> Then I answered and said to him, What are those two olive trees which are on the right and left of the candlestick?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V12">12&nbsp;</span> And I inquired a second time and said to him, What are those two branches of the olive trees which are in the handles of those two funnels of gold, which are pouring into and supplying the golden pipes?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V13">13&nbsp;</span> And he said to me, Dost thou not know what these are? And when I said, No, lord.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V2">2&nbsp;</span> And he said to me, What dost thou see? And I said, I see a flying sickle twenty cubits long, and ten cubits broad.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V3">3&nbsp;</span> Whereupon he said to me, This is the curse which is going forth over the face of the whole earth. Since every thief on the one hand is to be punished with death, and every false swearer on the other hand is to be punished;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V4">4&nbsp;</span> therefore I will bring it out saith the Lord Almighty; and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who sweareth by my name to a falsehood; and it shall lodge in his house, and destroy it with the timber and the stones thereof.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V5">5&nbsp;</span> Then the angel who was talking with me went out and said to me, Look up with thine eyes and see this which is going out.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V9">9&nbsp;</span> And I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and lo! two women came out, and there was a wind by their wings. Now they had the wings of a stork. And when they had lifted up the measure between heaven and earth,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V1">1&nbsp;</span> Then I turned, and lifting up mine eyes I looked, and lo! four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of brass.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V2">2&nbsp;</span> In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V6">6&nbsp;</span> That in which were the black horses went out to the land of the north; and the white went out after them; and the spotted went out to the land of the south;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V2">2&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, I have had a great jealousy of Jerusalem and Sion, and with great wrath I have been jealous of her.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V3">3&nbsp;</span> But thus saith the Lord, I will return to Sion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord Almighty, a holy mountain.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V4">4&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Again old men and matrons shall sit in the streets of Jerusalem, every one with his staff in his hand, for multitude of days;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V5">5&nbsp;</span> and the streets of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in her streets.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V6">6&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, If this shall appear impossible in the view of the remnant of this people in these days; shall it also be impossible in my view, saith the Lord Almighty?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Behold I will save my people from the land of the east and from the land of the west.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V8">8&nbsp;</span> And I will gather them and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V9">9&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Let your hands be strong, ye who in these days hear these words from the mouth of the prophets, from the clay the foundation of the house of the Lord Almighty was laid and during the time the temple hath been a building.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V10">10&nbsp;</span> For before those days, the earnings of the men could be of no avail, and the earnings of the cattle could not be lasting; nor could there be any security from affliction to him who went out or to him who came in. For I set all the men every one against his neighbour.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V11">11&nbsp;</span> But I will not now deal with the remnant of this people, as in the former days, saith the Lord Almighty:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V12">12&nbsp;</span> but will shew peace. Their vine shall yield its fruit. And the earth shall yield its products; and the heaven shall shed its dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V13">13&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass, that as you, the house of Juda and the house of Israel, were for a curse among the nations; so I will save you, and you shall be for a blessing. Be of good courage and let your hands be strong,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V14">14&nbsp;</span> for thus saith the Lord Almighty, In the same manner as I thought of afflicting you, when your fathers provoked me, saith the Lord Almighty and I relented not;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V15">15&nbsp;</span> so I have determined and have my mind bent, in these days, on prospering Jerusalem and the house of Juda. Be of good courage.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V16">16&nbsp;</span> These are the things which ye shall do; Speak truth every one to his neighbour; administer the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V17">17&nbsp;</span> and devise not evil in your hearts every one against his neighbour; and love not a false oath: for all these things I hate, saith the Lord Almighty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V18">18&nbsp;</span> Then a word of the Lord Almighty came to me, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V19">19&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, The fourth fast, and the fifth fast, and the seventh fast, and the tenth fast shall be to the house of Juda for joy and gladness and for cheerful festivals, and ye shall rejoice. Therefore love truth and peace.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V20">20&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, There shall yet come many peoples; and the inhabitants of many cities;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V21">21&nbsp;</span> even the inhabitants of five cities shall come together to one city, saying, Let us go to pray before the Lord and to seek the face of the Lord Almighty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V22">22&nbsp;</span> I am going. So many peoples and many nations will come to seek the face of the Lord Almighty at Jerusalem, and to conciliate the favour of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V23">23&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, If in those days ten men of all the tongues of the nations take hold, they must take hold of the skirt of a Jew, saying, We will go with thee, for we have heard that God is with you.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V1">1&nbsp;</span> A Burden of the word of the Lord. In the land of Sedrach and Damascus is his sacrifice, because the Lord hath an eye over men, particularly over all the tribes of Israel:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V2">2&nbsp;</span> in Hemath also; in the borders thereof. As for Tyre and Sidon, because they were very prudent,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V3">3&nbsp;</span> therefore Tyre built for herself bulwarks, and treasured up silver like dust, and collected gold like dirt in the highways;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V4">4&nbsp;</span> but on account of this the Lord will take possession of them, and he will smite her power into the sea; and she shall be consumed by fire.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V5">5&nbsp;</span> Ascalon shall see and be terrified; so shall Gaza, and be exceedingly pained: Akkaron also; because at her fall she was confounded. And a king shall perish out of Gaza; and Ascalon shall no more be inhabited.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V6">6&nbsp;</span> And strangers shall dwell in Azotus. And I will destroy the pride of the Philistines,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V7">7&nbsp;</span> and take away their blood out of their mouths, and their abominations from between their teeth. But they themselves shall be left for our God and shall be like a captain of a thousand in Juda; and Akkaron shall be like a Jebusite.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V8">8&nbsp;</span> And I will station for my house a guard not to be passed nor repassed. And the plunderer shall no more come against them; for now I have seen with mine own eyes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V9">9&nbsp;</span> Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Sion! Make proclamation, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold thy king is coming for thee. He is righteous and a saviour. He is meek and mounted on an ass, even a young colt.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V10">10&nbsp;</span> He will destroy chariots out of Ephraim and horses out of Jerusalem: and the battle bow shall be destroyed. And there shall be a multitude and peace from the nations; and he shall rule over waters to the sea, and over rivers to the ends of the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V11">11&nbsp;</span> As for thee, thou by the blood of thy covenant hast sent forth thy prisoners out of a pit which hath no water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V12">12&nbsp;</span> You the prisoners of the congregation shall be placed in strong holds, and for thy one day's sojourning I will make thee twofold compensation.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V13">13&nbsp;</span> For I have bent thee Juda, a bow for myself and filled it with Ephraim; and I will raise up thy sons, Sion, against the sons of Greece, and I will handle thee as the sword of a warrior.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V14">14&nbsp;</span> Let but the Lord be against them and he will dart out like a thunderbolt. The Lord Almighty will sound a trumpet, and march in the billow of his threat.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V15">15&nbsp;</span> The Lord Almighty will protect them, and they shall consume them and overwhelm them with sling stones; and drink them up as wine and fill the phials as an altar.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V16">16&nbsp;</span> In that day the Lord their God will save them; his people like a flock. Because holy stones are rolled on his land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V17">17&nbsp;</span> Because if there be any thing good it is his, if any thing comely it is his; with regard to corn for the youths, and flavourous wine for virgins,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V2">2&nbsp;</span> Because the prophesiers spoke of labours, and the diviners told false visions and lying dreams; gave false comfort, therefore they were dried up. Like sheep they were afflicted. Because there was no healing;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V3">3&nbsp;</span> against the shepherds my wrath is kindled; but over the lambs I will keep a strict watch. The Lord God Almighty will indeed watch over his flock, the house of Juda, and he will array them as his comely horse in battle.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V7">7&nbsp;</span> there shall be chilness and cold during one day. That will indeed be a memorable day to the Lord. It will neither be day nor night; but towards evening there will be light.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V8">8&nbsp;</span> And on that day living water will flow out of Jerusalem; the one half of it to the eastern sea and the one half of it to the western sea, both in summer and spring it shall be so.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V9">9&nbsp;</span> And the Lord will be king over all the earth. In that day there will be one Lord and his name one,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V10">10&nbsp;</span> enclosing for Jerusalem all the land and the desert around, from Gabea to Remmon southward. As for Rama, it shall continue in its place. From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, on to the gate of the corners and to the tower of Anameel, on to the king's wine presses</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V11">11&nbsp;</span> there shall be dwellers in it and there shall no more be a curse and in the inhabitance of Jerusalem they shall be secure.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V12">12&nbsp;</span> And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will smite all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem; their flesh shall waste away while they stand on their feet; and their eyes shall melt from their sockets, and their tongue shall rot in their mouth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V13">13&nbsp;</span> And in that day there shall be a great dread of the Lord upon them. And they will lay hold, every one, on the hand of his neighbour and his hand will be grasped in his neighbour's hand.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V14">14&nbsp;</span> And Juda will draw up in array in Jerusalem and collect the wealth of all the peoples around; gold and silver and raiment in great abundance.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V15">15&nbsp;</span> And the plague of the horses and the mules and the camels and the asses; that of all the cattle in those camps shall be the same as this plague.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V16">16&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass that all who are left of the nations which came against Jerusalem shall come up every year to worship the Lord Almighty and to celebrate the festival of tabernacles.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V17">17&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall not come up to Jerusalem from all the tribes of this land, to worship the king, the Lord Almighty, even they shall be added to those.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V18">18&nbsp;</span> But if the tribe of Egypt go not up nor come; upon them shall be the plague with which the Lord will smite all the nations which come not up to celebrate the festival of tabernacles.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V19">19&nbsp;</span> This shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations which decline to come up to celebrate the festival of tabernacles.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V20">20&nbsp;</span> In that day there shall be on the bridle of the horse, Holy to the Lord Almighty. And the kettles in the house of the Lord shall be like the bowls before the altar.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C14V21">21&nbsp;</span> And every kettle in Jerusalem and in Juda shall be holy to the Lord Almighty. And all that sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there shall no more be a Chananite in the house of the Lord Almighty in that day.</div>
