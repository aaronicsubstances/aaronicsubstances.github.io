<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> The words of Amos which came to him at Akkarim of Thekoue, which came to him in vision concerning Jerusalem in the days of Ozias king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joas, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> And he said, From Sion the Lord hath spoken with majesty, and from Jerusalem he uttered his voice, and the pastures of the shepherds mourned, and the top of Carmel withered.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said, For the three transgressions of Damascus, and for four shall I not be averse from it? Because with iron saws they sawed asunder the pregnant wives of the men of Galaad;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> therefore I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the foundations of BenAder.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> And I will break the bars of Damascus, and utterly destroy the inhabitants out of the plain of On, and I will cut off a tribe from the men of Charran, and the chosen people of Syria shall be made captives, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, shall I not be averse from them? Because they captivated the captives of the Salamonites, to deliver them up to Idumea;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> therefore I will send a fire against the walls of Gaza, and it shall devour the foundations thereof.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> And I will utterly destroy inhabitants out of Azotus, and a tribe shall be taken away from Ascalon; and I will lay my hand on Akkaron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall be destroyed saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Tyre, and for four shall I not be averse from it? Because they delivered up the captives of the Salamonites to Idumea, and did not remember the covenant of brothers;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> therefore I will send a fire against the walls of Tyre, and it shall devour the foundation thereof.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Idumea, and for four shall I not be averse from it? Because they pursued their brother with a sword, and violated a mother on the ground: he indeed to evidence his intention seized by force; he kept up his horror and his onset till he accomplished his purpose;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> therefore I will send a fire against Thaiman, and it shall consume the foundation of its walls.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of the Ammonites, and for four shall I not be averse from them? Because they ripped up the pregnant wives of the Galaadites, that they might enlarge their own borders;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> therefore against the walls of Rabbath I will kindle a fire, which shall consume its foundations, with a shout in the day of battle; and it shall be shaken in the day of its destruction;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> and its kings shall go into captivity, and their priests, and their chiefs together, saith the Lord.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Moab, and for four shall I not be averse from him? Because he burned into lime the bones of the king of Idumea;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> therefore I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the foundations of her cities, and Moab shall die of weakness: with shouting and with the clangour of trumpets,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of the children of Juda, and for four, shall I not be averse from him?

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, For the three transgressions of Israel, and for four, shall I not be averse from him? Because they sold a righteous one for silver and a needy one for a pair of sandals;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> and dashed their sandals against the heads of the poor; and turned aside the way of the meek; and a son and a father went in unto the same handmaid. That they might profane the name of their God,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> having bound their garments with cords of rushes, they pitched their tents near the altar, and drank, in the house of their God, wine got by extortion.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> As for me, I removed from before them the Amorite whose stature was like that of a cedar. Though he was strong as an oak, I withered his fruit above and his roots underneath.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> I indeed brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you about in the wilderness forty years, that you might inherit the land of the Amorites.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> And I took some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for a state of sanctification. Are not these things so, children of Israel? Saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> But you caused my sanctified ones to drink wine; and charged the prophets, saying, You shall not prophesy:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> Therefore behold I will roll under you, as a cart rolleth which is loaded with sheaves,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V14">14&nbsp;</span> so that flight shall perish from the swift runner; and the strong will not be master of his strength; and the warrior shall not save his life.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V15">15&nbsp;</span> And the bowman shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot escape; even the horseman shall not save his life.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> Will two walk together continually unless they agree?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> Will a lion roar from his forest when he hath no prey? Will a young lion utter a continued roar from his den unless he be tearing something?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> Will a bird fall on the ground unless he be shot? Will a gin on the ground be loosened, unless something be caught?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> Shall a trumpet sound in a city and the people not be alarmed? Can there be in a city a calamity which the Lord hath not inflicted?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> shall a lion roar and none be struck with dread? Hath the Lord spoken and will none prophesy?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V9">9&nbsp;</span> Make proclamation in the provinces of Assyria, and in the regions of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and see many wonderful things in the midst thereof, and the cruel oppression which is in it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V10">10&nbsp;</span> Now did she not know things which will be before her? Saith the Lord. They are treasuring up injustice and misery in their countries.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> Hear this word, ye heifers of Basanitis, ye who are on the mountain of Samaria; who tyrannise over the distressed and trample the needy, who say to your masters, Bring and let us drink.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> The Lord sweareth by his Holies, and lo! days are coming upon you when fiery pestilent men will seize you with arms; and throw them with you into boiling kettles:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> and you shall be dragged out naked over against one another, and cast out naked on the mountain Romman, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> You have gone to Baithel and committed transgression, to Galgala and multiplied transgressions, and have offered your sacrifices every morning, and your tythes every three days;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> for having publicly read a law they proclaimed thanksgivings. Proclaim them, because in such things the children of Israel delight, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> But as for me, I will give you gnashing of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places. When you returned not to me, saith the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> I withheld from you the rain three months before harvest; with an intent to rain on one city and on another city not to rain. One part was to be watered, and the part on which I did not rain, to be dried up;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V8">8&nbsp;</span> so that two or three cities should crowd to one city for drink and not be satisfied. And when you turned not to me, saith the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> I smote you with blasting and mildew: you multiplied your gardens; the caterpillar devoured your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive orchards. When even for this you turned not to me, saith the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V10">10&nbsp;</span> I sent death among you by the way of Egypt, and slew your young men with the sword and gave up your horses to capture: and by your rage I involved your camps in fire. And when even for this you turned not to me, saith the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorra; and you became like a brand plucked out of fire. Now as even for this you have not turned to me, saith the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V12">12&nbsp;</span> therefore in this manner will I deal with thee, Israel. But because I will deal thus with thee, prepare, Israel, to invoke thy God:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V13">13&nbsp;</span> for behold here am I, who give strength to thunder; Who create wind, and proclaim for men his anointed one; who make the morning dawn and thick darkness, and who walk on the high places of the earth, whose name is the Lord God, Omnipotent.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V1">1&nbsp;</span> Hear this word of the Lord: a song of Woe which I take up respecting you. The house of Israel is fallen. Shall it never more rise again?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V2">2&nbsp;</span> The virgin of Israel is prostrate on the ground. Is there none to raise her up?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V3">3&nbsp;</span> For this cause thus saith the Lord, Lord, of the city from which a thousand marched, there shall be left a hundred; and of the city, from which a hundred marched, ten shall be left to the house of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V4">4&nbsp;</span> Wherefore, thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel, Seek me and you shall live.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V5">5&nbsp;</span> But seek not Baithel, nor go to Galgal, nor pass on to the Well of Oath: because Galgal shall surely go into captivity, and Baithel shall be as if it had never existed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V6">6&nbsp;</span> Seek the Lord and live, that the house of Joseph may not blaze like a fire, and devour him: and the house of Israel have none to quench it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V7">7&nbsp;</span> He is the exalter of judgment and hath established righteousness for the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V8">8&nbsp;</span> He is the maker and the former of all things. He turneth darkness into day, and darkeneth the day into night. He calleth to him the water of the sea, and poureth it out on the face of the earth. His name is the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V9">9&nbsp;</span> He setteth destruction against strength and bringeth misery on bulwarks.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V10">10&nbsp;</span> They hated a reprover in the gates and held in abhorrence a holy word;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V11">11&nbsp;</span> therefore because they have beaten the poor with their fists, though you had received from them choice gifts; you have built houses of hewn stone; but in them you shall not dwell; you have planted lovely vineyards, but you shall not drink the wine thereof.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V12">12&nbsp;</span> Because I know your manifold impieties and your sins are mighty: you trample down the righteous, take pledges and turn aside the poor in the gates;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V13">13&nbsp;</span> therefore the prudent will at that time be silent because it is the time of wicked men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V14">14&nbsp;</span> Seek good and not evil that you may live, and so the Lord God Almighty will be with you. As you have said,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V15">15&nbsp;</span> We have hated evil and loved good; therefore reestablish judgment in the gates, that the Lord God Almighty may have compassion on the remnant of Joseph.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V16">16&nbsp;</span> For this purpose, saith the Lord, the God Almighty, in all the streets let there be wailing, and in all the highways let them say, Alas! Alas! Let the husbandman be called to lamentation and mourning, and to them who are skilled in the song of Woe.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V17">17&nbsp;</span> And in all the ways let there be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, said the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V18">18&nbsp;</span> Alas for them who desire the day of the Lord! Why should you desire the day of the Lord, when it is darkness and not light?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V19">19&nbsp;</span> As if a man would flee from the face of a lion and a bear met him, or, as if one would leap into a house and leaning his hand on the wall a serpent bit him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V20">20&nbsp;</span> Is not this day of the Lord darkness and not light; even thick darkness, in which there is not a ray of light?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V21">21&nbsp;</span> I have hated, I have rejected your festivals, and I will not smell your sacrifices at your solemn assemblies.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V22">22&nbsp;</span> Therefore though you offer me whole burnt offerings, I will not accept your sacrifices nor regard your sumptuous peace offerings.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V23">23&nbsp;</span> Take from me the noise of thy songs, and let me not hear the melody of musical instruments;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V24">24&nbsp;</span> but let judgment roll down like water, and righteousness like an impassable torrent.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V25">25&nbsp;</span> Did you, house of Israel offer to me burnt offerings and sacrifices, forty years in the wilderness?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V26">26&nbsp;</span> You have indeed taken up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Raiphan; those types of them which you have made for yourselves.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V3">3&nbsp;</span> relent, Lord at this. This therefore shall not be, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V4">4&nbsp;</span> So the Lord pointed out to me, and lo! the Lord had called for the punishment by fire and it was devouring the great abyss and consuming the portion of the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V5">5&nbsp;</span> whereupon I said, Cease, Lord, I beseech thee. Who shall raise up Jacob? Because he is very small, relent, Lord, at this.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V6">6&nbsp;</span> This then shall not be, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V7">7&nbsp;</span> So the Lord pointed out to me; and lo! he was standing on a wall of adamant and in his hand was an adamant.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V8">8&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said to me, What dost thou see, Amos? And when I said, An Adamant; the Lord said to me, Behold I interpose an adamant in the midst of my people Israel that I may no more permit them to transgress.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V9">9&nbsp;</span> Ridiculous altars shall indeed be utterly destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V10">10&nbsp;</span> Then Amasias the priest of Baithel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos is raising insurrections against thee in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V11">11&nbsp;</span> For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword; and Israel shall be carried away captive from his land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V12">12&nbsp;</span> Moreover Amasias said to Amos, Begone, seer. Get thee to the land of Juda and dwell there; and prophesy there:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V13">13&nbsp;</span> but against Baithel thou shalt not continue to prophesy; for it is the sanctuary of the king. It is the king's house.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V14">14&nbsp;</span> Whereupon Amos answered and said to Amasias, I was not a prophet, nor a son of a prophet. I was only a herdsman and a gatherer of dates;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V15">15&nbsp;</span> and the Lord took me from the flocks and the Lord said to me, Go and prophesy against my people Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V16">16&nbsp;</span> Now therefore hear a word of the Lord, Thou sayst, Prophesy not against Israel, and Thou shalt not give any disturbance to Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V17">17&nbsp;</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord. Thy wife shall be a prostitute in the city; and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword; and thy land shall be measured out with a line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land; and Israel shall be carried captive from his land.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V1">1&nbsp;</span> I saw the Lord standing on the altar, and he said, Smite the propitiatory and let the porches be shaken, and cut them down on the heads of them all; and those of them who are left I will slay with the sword.
