<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">Psalm 72  (73 in Tanakh)</div>
<div class="s2">Change of Outlook and Vision through Prayer</div>
<div class="s2">Heaven and Happiness not the Prosperity of Sinners</div>
<div class="d"><span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> (A Psalm by Asaph)</div>
<div class="q2">How good God is to Israel,</div>
<div class="q2">to those who are pure in heart!</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> Yet my feet had almost slipped;</div>
<div class="q2">I had nearly lost my foothold.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> For I was envious of the wicked,</div>
<div class="q2">when I saw the peace<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">peace: Heb; shalom = well-being, success, prosperity, security, happiness.</span></a> of sinners.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> For there is no objection<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">objection: They do not object to dying in sin and they offer no resistance to the devil. (Variant reading: revival). Hebrew of verse 4 seems to mean: For them there are no pains; fit and strong are their bodies.</span></a> in their death,</div>
<div class="q2">and in their scourging no severity.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> They are not in trouble like other men,</div>
<div class="q2">nor like other men are they scourged.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore pride holds full sway over them;</div>
<div class="q2">they are wrapped up in their wrongdoing and wickedness.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Their wrongdoing oozes from them like grease;</div>
<div class="q2">it passes into a state of heart.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> They think and speak with malice wickedly,</div>
<div class="q2">they speak blasphemy against the Most High.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> They poke their mouths at heaven,</div>
<div class="q2">but their tongues drag in the dirt.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> So My people will return here,</div>
<div class="q2">and full days will be found among them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> And they say, ‘How can God know?’</div>
<div class="q2">and, ‘Is there knowledge in the Most High?’</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> These are the sinners, yet they are prosperous;</div>
<div class="q2">they are for ever amassing wealth.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> And I said, ‘How useless to keep my heart right</div>
<div class="q2">and wash my hands among the innocent,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> only to be scourged all day long</div>
<div class="q2">and rebuked every morning!’</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> Had I said, ‘I will speak like that’,</div>
<div class="q2">I should have betrayed the family of Thy children.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> So I tried to understand it,</div>
<div class="q2">but it proved too hard for me,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> until I entered God’s sanctuary.</div>
<div class="q2">Then I understood their ends.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> It is because of their crooked ways</div>
<div class="q2">that Thou inflictest evils upon them.</div>
<div class="q2">Thou hurlest them down by their exaltation.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> How suddenly they come to ruin!<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">The apparent success and prosperity of the godless is transitory and short-lived.</span></a></div>
<div class="q2">They vanish, perish in their sin.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord,</div>
<div class="q2">Thou wilt reject their phantoms in Thy city.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> So when my heart was burning</div>
<div class="q2">and my thoughts kept changing,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> I was contemptible without knowing it;</div>
<div class="q2">I was like a beast before Thee.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> Yet I am continually with Thee;</div>
<div class="q2">Thou holdest my right hand.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> Thou guidest me in Thy will,</div>
<div class="q2">and receivest me with glory.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> For what is there in heaven for me,</div>
<div class="q2">and what do I want on earth but Thee?</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> My heart and my flesh fail;</div>
<div class="q2">Thou, O God, art the God of my heart</div>
<div class="q2">and my portion for ever.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">The death of the body is powerless to break the love-forged links of a soul’s union with God.</span></a></div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> Those who divorce themselves from Thee will perish;</div>
<div class="q2">Thou destroyest all who are unfaithful to Thee.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">‘unfaithful’: or, ‘who play the wanton from Thee.’ Idolatry is adultery or infidelity. Love brooks no rivals (Jas. 4:4-8; Dt. 5:9; Mt. 6:24).</span></a></div>
