He revealed himself this way.  <span class="verse" id="C21V2">2&#160;</span>Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,<a href="#C21FN1" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> or, Twin</span></a> Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.  <span class="verse" id="C21V3">3&#160;</span>Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.” </div><div class='p'>They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went out and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.  <span class="verse" id="C21V4">4&#160;</span>But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="C21V5">5&#160;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class='wj'>“Children, have you anything to eat?” </span> </div><div class='p'>They answered him, “No.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V6">6&#160;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”</span> </div><div class='p'>They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.  <span class="verse" id="C21V7">7&#160;</span>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” </div><div class='p'>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around himself (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.  <span class="verse" id="C21V8">8&#160;</span>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits<a href="#C21FN2" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> 200 cubits is about 100 yards or about 91 metres</span></a> away), dragging the net full of fish.  <span class="verse" id="C21V9">9&#160;</span>So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish and bread laid on it.  <span class="verse" id="C21V10">10&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V11">11&#160;</span>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of one hundred and fifty-three great fish. Even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V12">12&#160;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Come and eat breakfast!”</span> </div><div class='p'>None of the disciples dared enquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing that it was the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V13">13&#160;</span>Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.  <span class="verse" id="C21V14">14&#160;</span>This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="C21V15">15&#160;</span>So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class='wj'>“Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”</span> </div><div class='p'>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.” </div><div class='p'>He said to him, <span class='wj'>“Feed my lambs.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="C21V16">16&#160;</span>He said to him again a second time, <span class='wj'>“Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”</span> </div><div class='p'>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.” </div><div class='p'>He said to him, <span class='wj'>“Tend my sheep.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="C21V17">17&#160;</span>He said to him the third time, <span class='wj'>“Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?”</span> </div><div class='p'>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, <span class='wj'>“Do you have affection for me?”</span> He said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Feed my sheep. </span>  <span class="verse" id="C21V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to.

When he had said this, he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Follow me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V20">20&#160;</span>Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ chest at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”  <span class="verse" id="C21V21">21&#160;</span>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V22">22&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="C21V23">23&#160;</span>This saying therefore went out amongst the brothers<a href="#C21FN3" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a> that this disciple wouldn’t die. Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, <span class='wj'>“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C21V24">24&#160;</span>This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.  <span class="verse" id="C21V25">25&#160;</span>There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written. </div>
