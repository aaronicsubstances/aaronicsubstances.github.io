<div class="s2">The Wings of a Dove: Cast your Care on the Lord</div>
<div class="s2">Care is a Burden that Stoops the Heart</div>
<div class="d"><span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span> (A Prayer of Contemplation. By David)</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> Give ear, O God, to my prayer,</div>
<div class="q2">and despise not my petition.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> Attend to me and hear me.</div>
<div class="q2">I am grieved by my trial, and am troubled,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> because of the voice of the enemy,</div>
<div class="q2">and because of the oppression of the sinner;</div>
<div class="q2">for they have cast a slur upon me,</div>
<div class="q2">and have boiled with anger against me.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> My heart was troubled within me,</div>
<div class="q2">and fear of death fell upon me.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Fear and trembling came upon me,</div>
<div class="q2">and darkness overwhelmed me.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> And I said: ‘Who will give me wings like a dove,</div>
<div class="q2">and I will fly away and be at rest?’<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">I will fly by activity and be at rest by contemplation and humility.’ (St. John Climacus, Ladder 4:1)</span></a></div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Lo, far have I fled,</div>
<div class="q2">and have camped in the desert.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span> I waited for Him Who saves me</div>
<div class="q2">from faint-heartedness and from storm.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span> Drown their voices, O Lord, and divide their tongues,</div>
<div class="q2">for I see only iniquity and strife in the city.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Day and night they make the round of its walls.</div>
<div class="q2">Iniquity and trouble are in the midst of it,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> and injustice;</div>
<div class="q2">usury and fraud never leave its streets.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> For if an enemy had reproached me,</div>
<div class="q2">I could have borne it.</div>
<div class="q2">And if one who hated me had boasted against me,</div>
<div class="q2">I would have hidden myself from him.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span> But it was you, a man my equal,</div>
<div class="q2">my sovereign, and my friend,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span> who made sweet the food we shared together.</div>
<div class="q2">We walked to the house of God in harmony.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> Let death come upon them,</div>
<div class="q2">and let them go down alive to hell;</div>
<div class="q2">for evil is in their hearts and homes.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> As for me, I cried to God,</div>
<div class="q2">and the Lord heard me.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> In the evening and morning and at noon</div>
<div class="q2">I will tell and declare my needs</div>
<div class="q2">and He will hear my voice.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> He will redeem my soul in peace</div>
<div class="q2">from those who come near me,</div>
<div class="q2">for they were in crowds about me.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> God will hear and will humble them,</div>
<div class="q2">He Who is before the ages.</div>
<div class="qs">(Pause)</div>
<div class="q2">There is no change of heart for them,</div>
<div class="q2">for they do not fear God.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> He has stretched out His hand to requite them.</div>
<div class="q2">They have profaned His covenant.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> They were divided by the wrath of His countenance,</div>
<div class="q2">and their hearts drew near.</div>
<div class="q2">Their words are smoother than oil,</div>
<div class="q2">and yet they are swords.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> Cast your care on the Lord,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">cp. 1 Peter 5:7.</span></a></div>
<div class="q2">and He will support you.</div>
<div class="q2">He will never let a just man stumble.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> But Thou, O God, wilt bring them</div>
<div class="q2">into the pit of destruction.</div>
<div class="q2">Men of blood and deceit</div>
<div class="q2">will not live half their days.</div>
<div class="q2">But I will trust in Thee, O Lord.</div>
