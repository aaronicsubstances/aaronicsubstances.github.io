The army of their men of war was one hundred and seventy thousand footmen, plus twelve thousand horsemen, besides the baggage and the men who were on foot amongst them—an exceedingly great multitude.  <span class="verse" id="C7V3">3&#160;</span>They encamped in the valley near Bethulia, by the fountain.

Then he departed back to his people. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C7V8">8&#160;</span>All the rulers of the children of Esau, all the leaders of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast came to him and said,  <span class="verse" id="C7V9">9&#160;</span>“Let our lord now hear a word, that there not be losses in your army.  <span class="verse" id="C7V10">10&#160;</span>For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, for it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.  <span class="verse" id="C7V11">11&#160;</span>And now, my lord, don’t fight against them as men fight who join battle, and there will not so much as one man of your people perish.  <span class="verse" id="C7V12">12&#160;</span>Remain in your camp, and keep every man of your army safe. Let your servants get possession of the water spring, which flows from the foot of the mountain,  <span class="verse" id="C7V13">13&#160;</span>because all the inhabitants of Bethulia get their water from there. Then thirst will kill them, and they will give up their city.

They seized the waters and the springs of the waters of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="C7V18">18&#160;</span>The children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and encamped in the hill country near Dothaim. They sent some of them towards the south, and towards the east, near Ekrebel, which is near Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur. The rest of the army of the Assyrians encamped in the plain, and covered all the face of the land. Their tents and baggage were pitched upon it in a great crowd.

For we will be servants, and our souls will live, and we will not see the death of our babies before our eyes, and our wives and our children fainting in death.  <span class="verse" id="C7V28">28&#160;</span>We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and the Lord of our fathers, who punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers.

<div class='chapterlabel' id="C8V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C8V1">1&#160;</span>In those days Judith heard about this. She was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Oziel, the son of Elkiah, the son of Ananias, the son of Gideon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Ahitub, the son of Elihu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Salamiel, the son of Salasadai, the son of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="C8V2">2&#160;</span>Her husband was Manasses, of her tribe and of her family. He died in the days of barley harvest.  <span class="verse" id="C8V3">3&#160;</span>For he stood over those who bound sheaves in the field, and was overcome by the burning heat, and he fell on his bed, and died in his city Bethulia. So they buried him with his fathers in the field which is between Dothaim and Balamon.  <span class="verse" id="C8V4">4&#160;</span>Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.  <span class="verse" id="C8V5">5&#160;</span>She made herself a tent upon the roof of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins. The garments of her widowhood were upon her.  <span class="verse" id="C8V6">6&#160;</span>And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, except the eves of the Sabbaths, the Sabbaths, the eves of the new moons, the new moons, and the feasts and joyful days of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="C8V7">7&#160;</span>She was beautiful in appearance, and lovely to behold. Her husband Manasses had left her gold, silver, menservants, maidservants, cattle, and lands. She remained on those lands.  <span class="verse" id="C8V8">8&#160;</span>No one said anything evil about her, for she feared God exceedingly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C8V9">9&#160;</span>She heard the evil words of the people against the governor, because they fainted for lack of water; and Judith heard all the words that Ozias spoke to them, how he swore to them that he would deliver the city to the Assyrians after five days.  <span class="verse" id="C8V10">10&#160;</span>So she sent her maid, who was over all things that she had, to summon Ozias, Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of her city.  <span class="verse" id="C8V11">11&#160;</span>They came to her, and she said to them, “Hear me now, O you rulers of the inhabitants of Bethulia! For your word that you have spoken before the people this day is not right. You have set the oath which you have pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turns to help you.  <span class="verse" id="C8V12">12&#160;</span>Now who are you that you have tested God this day, and stand in the place of God amongst the children of men?  <span class="verse" id="C8V13">13&#160;</span>Now try the Lord Almighty, and you will never know anything.  <span class="verse" id="C8V14">14&#160;</span>For you will not find the depth of the heart of man, and you will not perceive the things that he thinks. How will you search out God, who has made all these things, and know his mind, and comprehend his purpose? No, my kindred, don’t provoke the Lord our God to anger!  <span class="verse" id="C8V15">15&#160;</span>For if he has not decided to help us within these five days, he has power to defend us in such time as he will, or to destroy us before the face of our enemies.  <span class="verse" id="C8V16">16&#160;</span>But don’t you pledge the counsels of the Lord our God! For God is not like a human being, that he should be threatened, neither is he like a son of man, that he should be won over by pleading.  <span class="verse" id="C8V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore let’s wait for the salvation that comes from him, and call upon him to help us. He will hear our voice, if it pleases him.  <span class="verse" id="C8V18">18&#160;</span>For there arose none in our age, neither is there any of us today, tribe, or kindred, or family, or city, which worship gods made with hands, as it was in the former days;  <span class="verse" id="C8V19">19&#160;</span>for which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for plunder, and fell with a great destruction before our enemies.  <span class="verse" id="C8V20">20&#160;</span>But we know no other god beside him. Therefore we hope that he will not despise us, nor any of our race.  <span class="verse" id="C8V21">21&#160;</span>For if we are captured, all Judea will be captured and our sanctuary will be plundered; and he will require our blood for profaning it.  <span class="verse" id="C8V22">22&#160;</span>The slaughter of our kindred, the captivity of the land, and the desolation of our inheritance, he will bring on our heads amongst the Gentiles, wherever we will be in bondage. We will be an offence and a reproach to those who take us for a possession.  <span class="verse" id="C8V23">23&#160;</span>For our bondage will not be ordered to favour; but the Lord our God will turn it to dishonour.  <span class="verse" id="C8V24">24&#160;</span>And now, kindred, let’s show an example to our kindred, because their soul depends on us, and the sanctuary, the house, and the altar depend on us.  <span class="verse" id="C8V25">25&#160;</span>Besides all this let’s give thanks to the Lord our God, who tries us, even as he did our fathers also.  <span class="verse" id="C8V26">26&#160;</span>Remember all the things which he did to Abraham, and all the things in which he tried Isaac, and all the things which happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="C8V27">27&#160;</span>For he has not tried us in the fire, as he did them, to search out their hearts, neither has he taken vengeance on us; but the Lord scourges those who come near to him, to admonish them.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C8V28">28&#160;</span>And Ozias said to her, “All that you have spoken, you have spoken with a good heart. There is no one who will deny your words.  <span class="verse" id="C8V29">29&#160;</span>For this is not the first day wherein your wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of your days all the people have known your understanding, because the disposition of your heart is good.  <span class="verse" id="C8V30">30&#160;</span>But the people were exceedingly thirsty, and compelled us to do as we spoke to them, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break.  <span class="verse" id="C8V31">31&#160;</span>And now pray for us, because you are a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we will faint no more.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C8V32">32&#160;</span>Then Judith said to them, “Hear me, and I will do a thing, which will go down to all generations amongst the children of our race.  <span class="verse" id="C8V33">33&#160;</span>You shall all stand at the gate tonight. I will go out with my maid. Within the days after which you said that you would deliver the city to our enemies, the Lord will deliver Israel by my hand.  <span class="verse" id="C8V34">34&#160;</span>But you shall not enquire of my act; for I will not tell you until the things are finished that I will do.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C8V35">35&#160;</span>Then Ozias and the rulers said to her, “Go in peace. May the Lord God be before you, to take vengeance on our enemies.”  <span class="verse" id="C8V36">36&#160;</span>So they returned from the tent, and went to their stations. </div>

O God, O my God, hear me also who am a widow.  <span class="verse" id="C9V5">5&#160;</span>For you did the things that were before those things, and those things, and such as come after; and you planned the things which are now, and the things which are to come.

They are exalted with horse and rider. They were proud of the strength of their footmen. They have trusted in shield, spear, bow, and sling. They don’t know that you are the Lord who breaks the battles. ‘The Lord’ is your name.  <span class="verse" id="C9V8">8&#160;</span>Break their strength in your power, and bring down their force in your wrath; for they intend to profane your sanctuary, and to defile the tabernacle where your glorious name rests, and to destroy the horn of your altar with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="C9V9">9&#160;</span>Look at their pride, and send your wrath upon their heads.

She put on her garments of gladness, which she used to wear in the days of the life of Manasses her husband.  <span class="verse" id="C10V4">4&#160;</span>She took sandals for her feet, and put on her anklet, bracelets, rings, earrings, and all her jewellery. She made herself very beautiful to deceive the eyes of all men who would see her.  <span class="verse" id="C10V5">5&#160;</span>She gave her maid a leather container of wine and a flask of oil, and filled a bag with roasted grain, lumps of figs, and fine bread.

The men of the city watched her until she had gone down the mountain, until she had passed the valley, and they could see her no more.  <span class="verse" id="C10V11">11&#160;</span>They went straight onward in the valley. The watch of the Assyrians met her;  <span class="verse" id="C10V12">12&#160;</span>and they took her, and asked her, “Of what people are you? Where are you coming from?

They came and surrounded her as she stood outside Holofernes’ tent, until they told him about her.  <span class="verse" id="C10V19">19&#160;</span>They marvelled at her beauty, and marvelled at the children of Israel because of her.

Take courage! You will live tonight, and hereafter;  <span class="verse" id="C11V4">4&#160;</span>for there is no one that will wrong you, but all will treat you well, as is done to the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar my lord.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C11V5">5&#160;</span>And Judith said to him, “Receive the words of your servant, and let your handmaid speak in your presence, and I won’t lie to my lord tonight.  <span class="verse" id="C11V6">6&#160;</span>If you will follow the words of your handmaid, God will bring the thing to pass perfectly with you; and my lord will not fail to accomplish his purposes.  <span class="verse" id="C11V7">7&#160;</span>As Nebuchadnezzar king of all the earth lives, and as his power lives, who has sent you for the preservation of every living thing, not only do men serve him by you, but also the beasts of the field, the cattle, and the birds of the sky will live through your strength, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar and of all his house.  <span class="verse" id="C11V8">8&#160;</span>For we have heard of your wisdom and the subtle plans of your soul.
