<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> Water covered their oppressors;</div>

<div class="q2">and sent surfeit into their souls.<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">Num. 11:34.</span></a></div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> They angered Moses in the camp,</div>

<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Num. 16:32.</span></a></div>

<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> And fire broke out in their company;</div>
<div class="q2">the flames burned up the sinners.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> They made a calf at Horeb</div>

<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span> They exchanged the glory of God</div>
<div class="q2">for the image of a bull that eats grass.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> They forgot God their Saviour,</div>
<div class="q2">Who had done great things in Egypt;</div>

<div class="q2">terrible things at the Red Sea.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> And He said He would destroy them,</div>
<div class="q2">had not Moses His chosen servant</div>
<div class="q2">stood in the breach before Him</div>
<div class="q2">to prevent His wrath from destroying them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> Then they despised the promised land;</div>
<div class="q2">they did not believe His word.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> And they murmured in their tents;</div>
<div class="q2">they did not obey the Lord’s voice.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> So He raised His hand against them</div>
<div class="q2">to lay them low in the wilderness,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> to scatter their children among the nations<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">children: lit. seed.</span></a></div>
<div class="q2">and disperse them in foreign lands.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> They were initiated to Baal-Phegor,</div>
<div class="q2">and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> And they provoked Him with their ways,</div>
<div class="q2">and the plague raged among them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> Then Phineas rose and made atonement,</div>
<div class="q2">and the outbreak was stopped.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> And this has been counted to him for righteousness</div>
<div class="q2">from age to age eternally.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> They angered Him too at the water of conflict,</div>
<div class="q2">and Moses suffered on their account.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> For they provoked his spirit,</div>
<div class="q2">and he spoke rashly with his lips.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span> They did not destroy the nations,</div>
<div class="q2">as the Lord had told them;</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span> but they mixed with the nations,</div>
<div class="q2">and learned their practices.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span> And they served their idols,</div>
<div class="q2">which became a snare to them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span> They even sacrificed their sons</div>
<div class="q2">and their daughters to demons,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span> and shed innocent blood,</div>
<div class="q2">the blood of their sons and daughters,</div>
<div class="q2">whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.</div>
<div class="q2">And the land was polluted with blood</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span> and defiled by their practices,</div>
<div class="q2">and they played the wanton by their ways.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord raged with fury against His people</div>
<div class="q2">and abhorred His inheritance.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span> And He delivered them into the hands of their enemies,</div>
<div class="q2">and those who hated them ruled over them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span> Their enemies oppressed them,</div>
<div class="q2">and they were humbled under their hands.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span> Many times He delivered them,</div>
<div class="q2">but they provoked Him by their wilfulness</div>
<div class="q2">and were humbled for their iniquities.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span> Yet the Lord saw when they were in trouble,</div>
<div class="q2">and He heard their prayer</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span> and He remembered His covenant,</div>
<div class="q2">and in His great mercy He relented.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span> He even roused compassion for them</div>
<div class="q2">among all who took them captive.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span> Save us, O Lord our God,</div>
<div class="q2">and gather us from among the nations,</div>
<div class="q2">that we may give thanks to Thy holy name</div>
<div class="q2">and triumph in Thy praise.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel</div>
<div class="q2">from age to age.</div>
