<h1>Tronfoncus</h1>
<p>The Tronfoncus is not copyrighted. It is in the Public Domain. However "Tronfoncus" is a Trademark.</p>
<p>You may copy, publish, proclaim, distribute, redistribute, sell, give away, quote, memorize, read publicly, broadcast, transmit, share, back up, post on the Internet, print, reproduce, preach, teach from, and use the Tronfoncus as much as you want, and others may also do so. All we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the Tronfoncus in any way, you not call the result the Tronfoncus any more. This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who have worked on this translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the Public Domain.</p>

The email is gmail, and so the address is contact.aaronicsubstances (guess what follows) dot com (this indirect way of giving out the email is to prevent email harvesters from sending spam to the site owners).</p>
