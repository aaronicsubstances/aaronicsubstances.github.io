<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> My mouth will speak wisdom</div>
<div class="q2">as the meditation of my heart brings understanding.</div>

<div class="q2">I will expound my problem on the harp.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Why should I fear on an evil day,</div>
<div class="q2">when iniquity dogs my heel and surrounds me?</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> Some trust in their power,</div>
<div class="q2">and some boast of the amount of their wealth.</div>

<div class="q2">Will he not see corruption</div>
<div class="q2">when he sees the wise dying?</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> The fool and the dolt perish together,</div>
<div class="q2">and they leave their riches to strangers.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> And their graves are their homes for ever,</div>
<div class="q2">their dwelling-places for all generations;</div>
