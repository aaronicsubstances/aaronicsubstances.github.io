<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, a word of the Lord came by the ministry of Haggai the prophet, saying, Say to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, these words:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, This people say, The time is not come to build the house of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> Now a word of the Lord is come by the ministry of Haggai the prophet, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> Is it indeed time for you to dwell in your cieled houses, whilst this house of ours is lying waste?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> Now therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Turn your thoughts on your ways.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> You have sown much and gathered little. You have eaten but have not had enough. You have drunk, but not plentifully; you have clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed. And he who earned wages put it in a bag with holes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty apply your thoughts to these ways of yours:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> Go up to the mountain and cut timber. Build this house that I may take pleasure in it and be glorified, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> You have looked for much, but little came; and when it was brought home I blowed upon it on this account, saith the Lord, because my house is waste and you attend every one to his own house;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> therefore the heaven shall refrain from dew and the earth shall withhold her products;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> and I will bring a sword on this land and on the mountains, and on the corn, and on the wine, and on the oil even on all that the earth produceth, and on the men and on the cattle and on all the labours of their hands.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of the prophet Haggai, as the Lord their God had sent him to them. And when the people were terrified at the presence of the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> then Haggai, a messenger of the Lord among the messengers of the Lord to the people, said, I am with you saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they went and worked at the house of the Lord Almighty their God</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> on the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> In the seventh month, on the twenty first day of the month, the Lord spoke by the ministry of Haggai the prophet, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> Speak now to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedek the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> Is there any of you who hath seen this house in its former glory? How then must you look upon this now as a mere nothing before you!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> But be strong now Zorobabel, saith the Lord; and be strong, Jesus son of Josedek the high priest; and be strong all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you saith the Lord Almighty,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> and my spirit is in the midst of you. Be of good courage;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> for thus saith the Lord Almighty, Yet once more, I will shake the heaven and the earth including the sea and dry land,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> and I will convulse all the nations; and the choice things of all the nations will come, and I will fill this very house with glory, saith the Lord Almighty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> The silver is mine and the gold is mine, saith the Lord Almighty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> Because the glory of this house shall be great, the latter greater than the first, saith the Lord Almighty; therefore in this very place I will give peace, saith the Lord Almighty; even peace of mind for a possession to every one active in again raising up this temple.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> On the twenty fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, a word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Ask the priests the law, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> If a man take holy flesh in the skirt of his mantle; and the skirt of his mantle touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any kind of food, will they be hallowed? And the priest in reply, said, No.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> Then Haggai said, If a polluted person; one who is unclean by a dead body touch any of these things will they be polluted? And the priests answered and said, they will be polluted.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V14">14&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Haggai said in reply, so is this people and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord: and so are all the works of their hands. And whoever shall come near there shall be polluted because of their morning burdens. Are they to be afflicted with grief on account of their toils? And have you hated a reprover in the gates?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V15">15&nbsp;</span> Recollect now, I beseech you, from that day back, before there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, What were ye?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V16">16&nbsp;</span> When you came to measure twenty measures of barley, it was become ten. And when you went to the wine lake to draw off fifty measures, there were only twenty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V17">17&nbsp;</span> I smote you with blasting and mildew and hail in all the works of your hands when you turned not to me, saith the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V18">18&nbsp;</span> Turn now your thoughts from this day forward, from this twenty fourth of the ninth month: and from the day on which the foundation of the house of the Lord is laid,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V19">19&nbsp;</span> lay up in your minds whether that will be the case in the threshing floor? whether the vine or the fig tree or the pomegranate or the olive tree will any more be unproductive? From this very day I will bless.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V20">20&nbsp;</span> Moreover a word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai the prophet on the twenty fourth day of the month, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V21">21&nbsp;</span> Say to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel of the tribe of Juda; Say, I will shake the heaven and the earth including the sea and the dry land,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V22">22&nbsp;</span> and I will overthrow the thrones of kings and destroy the power of the kings of the nations: and I will overthrow the chariots and the charioteers; and horses and their riders shall come down every one with a sword against his brother.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V23">23&nbsp;</span> On that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I will take thee Zorobabel the son of Salathiel my servant, saith the Lord, and make thee a signet, because I have chosen thee, saith the Lord Almighty.</div>
