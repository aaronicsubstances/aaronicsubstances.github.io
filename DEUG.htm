<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel, on the bank of the Jordan, west of the wilderness which reacheth to the Red sea, between Pharantophal and Lobon, and Aulon, and Katachrusea,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> eleven days' journey from Choreb, the way by mount Seir to Kades-Barne.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to all the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had given him in charge to them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> After he had smitten Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon; and Og, king of Basan, who dwelt at Astaroth and Edrain,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> Moses began, on the bank of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, to explain the law fully, saying.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> The Lord our God spoke to us at Choreb, saying, You have tarried long enough by this mount.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> Turn; strike your tents, and march to the mountain of the Amorites, and to all the inhabitants around Araba; to the mountain and to the plain, and to the south, and to the land of the Chananites, on the sea shore, and to Antilibanus, till you reach the river; the great river Euphrates.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> Behold I have delivered up the land before you. Go in, and take possession of the land, which with an oath I promised to give to your fathers; to Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob; to them and their seed after them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> Then I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able alone to bear you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> The Lord your God hath multiplied you; and behold you are this day like the stars of heaven for multitude.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> May the Lord, the God of your fathers, add to you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you as he hath promised you!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> How can I alone bear the burden of you, even the whole weight of you, and your contentions?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> Appoint for yourselves men of wisdom, knowledge and understanding, for your several tribes, and I will make them leaders over you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> And you answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast proposed to do is good.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> So I took from among you men of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, and appointed them to be leaders over you; captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens; and promulgators of the law for your judges.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> And I gave a charge to your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger who is with him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt not respect a person in judgment. Against the low and the high thou shalt pass sentence, and not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's. And if the matter be too hard for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&nbsp;</span> And when I had given you in charge, at that time, all the things which you were to do,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&nbsp;</span> we removed from Choreb, and marched through all that great and frightful wilderness which you saw, on the way to the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God commanded us. And when we came to Kades-barne,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&nbsp;</span> I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God giveth you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&nbsp;</span> Behold the Lord your God hath delivered up to you the land before you. Go up and take possession of it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, commanded you. Fear not, nor be faint hearted.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V22">22&nbsp;</span> Whereupon you all came to me, and said, Let us send men before us, and let them traverse the land for us, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities we shall come.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V23">23&nbsp;</span> And the proposal was agreeable to me. So I took from among you twelve men; a man for every tribe.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V24">24&nbsp;</span> And they turned, and went up to the mountain, and came to the valley of the bunch of grapes. And when they had thoroughly viewed it,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V25">25&nbsp;</span> they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good, which the Lord our God giveth us.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V26">26&nbsp;</span> Notwithstanding this, you would not go up; but disobeyed the command of the Lord our God,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V27">27&nbsp;</span> and murmured in your tents, saying, Because the Lord hateth us he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us utterly,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V28">28&nbsp;</span> wherever we go. When your brethren disheartened you, saying, It is a nation great and numerous, and stronger than we; and the cities are large, and walled up to the sky. Indeed we have seen there sons of giants.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V29">29&nbsp;</span> I said to you, Be not terrified, nor afraid of them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V30">30&nbsp;</span> The Lord your God is marching before you. He will assist you in subduing them, according to all that he hath done for you in the land of Egypt,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V31">31&nbsp;</span> and in that wilderness, which you have seen in your march to this mountain of the Amorite. The Lord thy God will take charge of thee, as a man would of a son; as he hath done all the way you marched, till you came to this place.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V32">32&nbsp;</span> Notwithstanding this speech you did not confide in the Lord our God</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V33">33&nbsp;</span> who was marching before you in the way to chuse a place for you, conducting you by night with fire, pointing out to you the way in which you were to march; and by day, with a pillar of cloud.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V34">34&nbsp;</span> And the Lord heard the sound of your words, and being provoked to wrath, he sware saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V35">35&nbsp;</span> Not one of these men shall see that good land which I, with an oath, promised their fathers,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V36">36&nbsp;</span> save Chaleb son of Jephonne. He shall see it. And to him I will give the land to which he went up, and to his children, because he vindicateth the cause of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V37">37&nbsp;</span> With me also the Lord was angry on your account, and said, Neither shalt thou go in there.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V38">38&nbsp;</span> Joshua son of Nave who is thy attendant; he shall go thither. Encourage him, for he shall distribute it, by lot, to Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V39">39&nbsp;</span> And with respect to your children, who do not know good or evil, they shall go thither, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V40">40&nbsp;</span> But as for you, turn, and march into the wilderness, by the way to the Red sea.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V41">41&nbsp;</span> Then you answered, and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God. We will go up, and fight according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. So, every one seizing his implements of war, you assembled tumultuously to go up the mountain.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V42">42&nbsp;</span> Whereupon the Lord said to me, Say to them, You shall not go up, nor fight; for I am not with you. And you should not be trodden down before your enemies.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V43">43&nbsp;</span> Accordingly I spoke to you; but you hearkened not to me; but transgressed the command of the Lord, and presumptuously ascended the mountain.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V44">44&nbsp;</span> And the Amorites, who dwelt on the mountain, came out to meet you, and pursued you, as bees would do, and slaughtered you from Seir to Herma.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V45">45&nbsp;</span> Then you sat down, and wept before the Lord our God; but the Lord hearkened not to your voice, nor paid attention to you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V46">46&nbsp;</span> So you abode at Kades many days, as many as you had staid there before.</div>

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">2</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> Then we turned, and took up our march into the wilderness, by the way to the Red sea, as the Lord spoke to me. And when we had been many days circling round mount Seir,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> the Lord said to me,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> You have been long enough circling round this mountain, therefore turn northward,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> and give thou a charge to this people, saying, You are about to march along by the borders of your brethren, the children of Esau who inhabit Seir. They will be afraid of you, and dread you exceedingly.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> You must not come to battle with them; for I will not give you a foot of their land, because I have given mount Seir to the children of Esau for a possession.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> Buy provisions of them for money, that you may eat, and receive of them water by measure, for money, that you may drink;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> (for the Lord our God had blessed thee in all the works of thy hands.) Recollect how thou didst traverse that great and frightful wilderness. Behold! for forty years the Lord thy God was with thee. Thou wast not in want of any thing.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who inhabit Seir, by the way of Araba, from Ailon to Gesion-gaber, and wheeling about had crossed the wilderness of Moab,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> the Lord said to me, Act not as enemies against the Moabites; nor come to a battle with them; for I will not give you for a possession any of their land; for I have given Aroer to the children of Lot, that they may inherit it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> (Now the Ommins had formerly dwelt there, a nation great and numerous,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> and mighty as the Enakims; they as well as the Enakims may be accounted Raphains; but the Moabites call them Ommins.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> And in Seir the Chorrites were formerly settled, but the children of Esau destroyed them, and rooted them out from before them, and dwelt in their stead, in the same manner as Israel hath done with the land of their possession which the Lord hath given them.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> Now therefore arise, and strike your tents, and cross the valley of Zaret.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V14">14&nbsp;</span> Now the time we spent from Kades-barne till we came to the valley of Zaret, was thirty eight years; until all the generation of the warriors had fallen, and died out of the camp. As the Lord had, with an oath denounced against them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V15">15&nbsp;</span> the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them from among the host until they had all fallen.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V16">16&nbsp;</span> And when all the warriors had fallen, and died from among the people,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V17">17&nbsp;</span> the Lord spoke to me, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V18">18&nbsp;</span> Thou art now to pass by Aroer, along the borders of Moab;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V19">19&nbsp;</span> when you come near to the children of Amman you must not act hostilely against them, nor come to battle with them; for I will not give thee any of the land of the children of Amman for a possession; because I have given it for a possession to the children of Lot.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V20">20&nbsp;</span> (It may be accounted the land of the Raphains, for the Raphains formerly dwelt there, but the Ammanites call them Zochommins</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V21">21&nbsp;</span> They, as well as the Enakims, were a nation great and numerous, and much stronger than you; but the Lord destroyed them from before the Ammanites, and they took possession of the country, and have dwelt therein in their stead, even to this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V22">22&nbsp;</span> The same was the case with the children of Esau who inhabit Seir, they, in like manner, destroyed the Chorrites from before them, and took possession of their country, and have dwelt therein, in their stead, even to this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V23">23&nbsp;</span> So it was with the Evites when they dwelt in Asedoth even to Gaza, the Cappadocians, who came out of Cappadocia, rooted them out, and dwelt in their stead.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V24">24&nbsp;</span> Now therefore arise, strike your tents, and cross the vale of Arnon; behold I have delivered into thy hand Seon, king of Esebon, the Amorite, with his land. Begin to take possession. Join battle with him this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V25">25&nbsp;</span> Begin to impress the fear of thee, and the dread of thee, on the face of all the nations under heaven. They who hear of thy name shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V26">26&nbsp;</span> Now I had sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedamoth to Seon, king of Esebon, with words of peace, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V27">27&nbsp;</span> Let me pass through thy land. I will march along the highway, and not turn aside to the right, nor to the left.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V28">28&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt sell me provisions for money, that I may eat; and thou shalt sell me water for money, that I may drink, just till I can march through on foot;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V29">29&nbsp;</span> as the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and the children of Moab, who dwell in Aroer have done to me, until I cross the Jordan, to the land which the Lord our God giveth us.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V30">30&nbsp;</span> But Seon, king of Esebon, would not consent that we should pass by him, for the Lord our God had emboldened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as at this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V31">31&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord said to me, Behold I have begun to deliver up before thee Seon, king of Esebon, the Amorite, and his land. Begin therefore to take possession of his land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V32">32&nbsp;</span> So Seon, king of Esebon, came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Jassa.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V33">33&nbsp;</span> And the Lord our God delivered him up before us. And we smote him and his sons, and all his people,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V34">34&nbsp;</span> and took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city one after another; with their wives and children. We left none to be taken alive.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V35">35&nbsp;</span> Besides making a prey of their cattle, we took the spoils of their cities.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V36">36&nbsp;</span> From Aroer, which is on the banks of the brook Arnon, including the city in the vale, even to mount Galaad, there was not a city which escaped us. The Lord our God delivered them all into our hands.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V37">37&nbsp;</span> Moreover, when, without approaching the children of Amman, we had taken all his territories on the brook Jabok, and his cities in the hilly country, as the Lord our God commanded us,</div>

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">3</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V1">1&nbsp;</span> we turned and went up the way to Basan. And when Og, king of Basan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrain,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> the Lord said to me, Fear him not; for into thy hand I have delivered him, and all his people, and all his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Seon, the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Esebon.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> So the Lord our God delivered also into our hands Og, king of Basan, and all his people, and we smote him till there was none of his seed left.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> And we took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them; three score cities, the whole region of Argob, belonging to Og, king of Basan;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> All the cities fortified with high walls, bars and gates, besides the towns of the Pherezites, which were very many,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> we utterly destroyed. As we had done to Seon, king of Esebon, we destroyed every city, one after another, and the women and children.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V7">7&nbsp;</span> But all the cattle, and the spoils of the cities, we took for ourselves.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> So, at that time, we took this land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were on the banks of the Jordan, from the brook Arnon even to Aermon</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V9">9&nbsp;</span> (now the Phoenicians call Aermon Sanior and the Amorites call it Sanir)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V10">10&nbsp;</span> including all the cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan, as far as Elcha, and Adraim, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V11">11&nbsp;</span> (For besides Og, king of Basan, there was not one of the Raphains left. Behold his bed was a bed of iron. Behold it is in the citadel of the Ammanites. The length of it is nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, after the cubit of a man.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V12">12&nbsp;</span> And we took possession of this land, at that time, from Aroer, which is on the bank of the brook Arnon, and the half of mount Galaad; and I gave all the cities thereof to Reuben, and Gad.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V13">13&nbsp;</span> And the rest of Galaad, and all Basan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half of the tribe of Manasses, with all the region of Argob, even all that part of Basan which is to be accounted the land of the Raphains.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V14">14&nbsp;</span> (Now when Jair the Manassite took the region of Argob, even to the borders of Gergesi, and Machathi, he called it after his own name Basan-Thavoth-Jair which is now its name.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V15">15&nbsp;</span> Now when I gave Galaad to the Machirites</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V16">16&nbsp;</span> and to Reuben and Gad, all below Galaad, to the brook Arnon, the middle of the brook being the boundary; and as far as Jabok, this brook being the boundary of the Ammanites,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V17">17&nbsp;</span> and Araba, and the Jordan the boundary of Machanareth, even to the sea of Araba, the salt sea below Asedoth, the Phasga of the East,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V18">18&nbsp;</span> I gave you a charge at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given you this land for a possession, you shall go armed before your brethren, the children of Israel, all of you who are fit for war,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V19">19&nbsp;</span> (but your wives, and your children, and your cattle, for I know that you have much cattle, are to dwell in your cities, which I have given you)</div>

Then you shall return, every one to his possession which I have given you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V21">21&nbsp;</span> And at the same time I gave a charge to Joshua, saying, Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God hath done to these two kings. In the same manner the Lord our God will deal with all those kingdoms against which you are going to cross over.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V22">22&nbsp;</span> You shall not be afraid of them, for the Lord our God will fight for you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V23">23&nbsp;</span> I also supplicated the Lord, at that time, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V24">24&nbsp;</span> Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy majesty, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and thy outstretched arm; for what god is there in heaven, or on earth, who can do as thou hast done, or according to thy majesty.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V25">25&nbsp;</span> Let me cross over, and see that land, that good land which is beyond the Jordan, and that goodly mountain Antilibanus.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V26">26&nbsp;</span> But the Lord overlooked me, because of you, and would not hearken to me. And the Lord said to me, Let this suffice thee. Speak no more on this subject.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V27">27&nbsp;</span> Go up to the top of the craggy mountain, and raise thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and take a view of it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not cross this Jordan.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V28">28&nbsp;</span> And give a charge to Joshua, and strengthen and encourage him; for he shall cross over before this people, and shall give them the possession of all this land which thou hast seen.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> Now therefore, hear, Israel, the rules of rectitude, and the judgments, which I this day teach you to practise, that you may live, and multiply, and go in, and possess the land, which the Lord the God of your fathers giveth you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> You shall not add any thing to what I command you; nor shall you diminish from it. You shall keep the commandments of the Lord our God, which I, this day, give you in charge.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God did because of Beelphegor; that as for every man who went after Beelphegor; him the Lord our God destroyed from among you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> But as for you who adhered to the Lord your God, you are all alive this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> Behold, I have taught you rules of rectitude, and judgments, as the Lord commanded me; that you may act agreeably thereto, in the land to which you are going, to take possession of it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore keep them, and practise them. For this will be your wisdom, and your understanding, in the sight of all the nations. Whoever shall chance to hear all these rules of rectitude, will say, Behold this is a wise and understanding people a great nation.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> For how great must that nation be, which hath God near them, as the Lord our God is on all occasions, if we call upon him!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V8">8&nbsp;</span> And how great must the nation be, which hath such rules of rectitude, and such righteous judgments, as are contained in the whole law, which I this day lay before you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently. Forget not all the things which thine eyes have seen, and let them not depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; that thou mayst impress upon thy children, and thy childrens' children,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V10">10&nbsp;</span> that day when you stood in the presence of the Lord our God at Choreb, on the day of the solemn assembly. For the Lord said to me, Assemble the people before me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days they live on the earth. And let them teach their children.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> So you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain. Though the mountain was blazing with fire up to heaven, there was darkness, thick darkness, a turbid tempest.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V12">12&nbsp;</span> And the Lord uttered to you, from the midst of the fire, the sound of words which you heard. You saw no similitude, but only heard a voice.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V13">13&nbsp;</span> And when he had declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments, he wrote them on two tables of stone.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V14">14&nbsp;</span> And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you rules of rectitude, and judgments, for you to practise in the land to which you are going, to take possession of it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V15">15&nbsp;</span> Therefore watch your souls with diligence; for you saw no similitude on the day when the Lord spoke to you at Choreb, in the mount, out of the midst of the fire;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V16">16&nbsp;</span> that you may not transgress, and make for yourselves a graven image; any kind of image, the likeness of man or woman;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V17">17&nbsp;</span> the likeness of any of the beasts which are on the earth; the likeness of any winged bird, which flieth in the air;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V18">18&nbsp;</span> the likeness of any reptile, which creepeth on the ground; the likeness of any fish which is in the waters below the earth;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V19">19&nbsp;</span> and that upon looking up to heaven, and seeing the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and all the host of heaven, thou mayst not be led astray, and worship them, and perform religious service to those things which the Lord thy God hath arranged in due order, for all the nations which are under heaven.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V20">20&nbsp;</span> God hath indeed taken you and brought you out of the land of Egypt; out of the iron furnace; out of Egypt, to be to him a chosen people, as at this day;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V21">21&nbsp;</span> but with me the Lord God was angry for the things spoken by you, and he solemnly said that I should not cross this Jordan, and that I should not enter that land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for a possession.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V22">22&nbsp;</span> For I am to die in this land, and not to cross that Jordan; but you are to cross it. When you shall possess that good land,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V23">23&nbsp;</span> take heed to yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the Lord our God, which he made with you, and transgress and make for yourselves a graven image of any of the things about which the Lord thy God hath given thee a charge;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V24">24&nbsp;</span> for the Lord thy God is a consuming fire; a zealous God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V25">25&nbsp;</span> If therefore, when you have begotten sons, and sons' sons, and have been long in the land, you transgress, and make a graven image; the likeness of any thing whatever, and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V26">26&nbsp;</span> I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you, that you shall surely perish from the land, to which you are going, to cross the Jordan there to take possession of it. You shall not prolong your days therein, but shall be utterly rooted out.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V27">27&nbsp;</span> And the Lord will scatter you among all the nations, and you shall be left few in number, among all the nations, to which the Lord will bring you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V28">28&nbsp;</span> And there you shall serve other gods, the works of men's hands, stocks and stones, which can neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V29">29&nbsp;</span> Yet there, on seeking the Lord your God you will find him, when you seek him with your whole heart and with your whole soul;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V30">30&nbsp;</span> In thy affliction, when all these things have come upon thee in the latter days, when thou shalt turn to the Lord thy God, and hearken to his voice;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V31">31&nbsp;</span> because the Lord thy God is a merciful God; he will not forsake thee utterly, nor totally destroy thee. He will not forget the covenant of thy fathers, which the Lord confirmed to them with an oath.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V32">32&nbsp;</span> Enquire of the days which are past; those which were before thee, from the day God created man on the earth, and from one end of heaven to the other; hath there ever been any thing like this great thing? Hath any thing been heard like it?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V33">33&nbsp;</span> Hath any nation heard the voice of the living God, speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and are still alive?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V34">34&nbsp;</span> Or hath God come, and made trial to take for himself a nation out of the midst of a nation, by trials, and by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and with a strong hand, and an outstretched arm, and with great visions, according to all that the Lord our God hath done in Egypt, before thine eyes?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V35">35&nbsp;</span> So that thou must needs know that the Lord thy God is very God, and that there is none else besides him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V36">36&nbsp;</span> From heaven he caused his voice to be heard to instruct thee; and on earth he shewed thee his great fire. And thou hast heard his words out of the midst of the fire.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V37">37&nbsp;</span> Because he loved thy fathers, he chose you their seed after them; and by his mighty power he hath brought thee out of Egypt,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V38">38&nbsp;</span> to destroy nations greater and mightier than thou art, before thee; to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a possession, as is the case with thee this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V39">39&nbsp;</span> Know therefore this day, and revolve it in thy mind, that the Lord thy God is alone God, in the heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and that there is none other besides him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V40">40&nbsp;</span> You shall therefore keep his commandments, and his rules of rectitude, which I this day give you in charge, that it may be well with thee and with thy children after thee; that you may live long in the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V41">41&nbsp;</span> Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, towards the rising of the sun,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V42">42&nbsp;</span> for the slayer to flee to. Whoever should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past, might flee to one of these cities, and live,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V43">43&nbsp;</span> namely, Bosor, in the wilderness, in the plain, for the Reubenites; and Bamoth, in Galaaditis, for the Gadites; and Gaulon, in Basan, for the Manassites.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V44">44&nbsp;</span> This is the law which Moses laid before the children of Israel;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V45">45&nbsp;</span> these are the testimonies, and the rules of rectitude, and the judgments, which Moses delivered in his speech to the Israelites, after they came out of the land of Egypt</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V46">46&nbsp;</span> on the bank of the Jordan, in the vale near the house of Phogor, in the land of Seon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Esebon, whom Moses and the Israelites slew after their coming out of the land of Egypt,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V47">47&nbsp;</span> when they took possession both of this land, and the land of Og king of Basan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were on the side of the Jordan towards the rising of the sun,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V48">48&nbsp;</span> from Aroer, which is on the border of the brook Arnon, to the mountain of Seon, which is Aermon,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V49">49&nbsp;</span> comprehending all that part of Araba on the eastern bank of Jordan, below the cliff of Asedoth.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V1">1&nbsp;</span> When Moses had convened all Israel, he said to them Hear, Israel, the rules of rectitude and the judgments, which I this day deliver in your hearing, that you may learn them, and may be careful to perform them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V2">2&nbsp;</span> The Lord your God made a covenant with you at Choreb.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V3">3&nbsp;</span> It was not only with your fathers that the Lord made this covenant, but with you also; with you who are all here alive this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V4">4&nbsp;</span> Face to face the Lord spoke to you, at that mountain, out of the midst of the fire.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V5">5&nbsp;</span> I indeed stood between the Lord and you, at that time, to declare to you the words of the Lord, because you were terrified at the fire, and did not go up to the mountain;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V6">6&nbsp;</span> and he said, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V8">8&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt not make for thyself an idol, nor the likeness of any thing in the heaven above, or of any of the things which are on the earth below, or which are in the waters below the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V9">9&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt not worship them, nor serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a zealous God, retributing, to them who hate me, the sins of fathers upon children, to the third and fourth generation,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V10">10&nbsp;</span> and shewing mercy for thousands of generations to them who love me, and keep my commandments.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V11">11&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord thy God will not purify him who taketh his name in vain.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V12">12&nbsp;</span> Keep the day of the sabbaths to hallow it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V13">13&nbsp;</span> Labour six days, and do all thy works;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V14">14&nbsp;</span> but on the seventh day are the sabbaths for the Lord thy God. On it thou shalt not do any work; neither thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man servant nor thy maid servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor the proselyte who sojourneth with thee; that thy man servant, and thy maid servant, and thy labouring beast may rest as well as thou.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V15">15&nbsp;</span> Remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm; for this cause the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to keep the day of the sabbaths and hallow it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V16">16&nbsp;</span> Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayst live long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V17">17&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt not commit murder.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V22">22&nbsp;</span> These are the injunctions which the Lord delivered verbally, to all your congregation, at the mount, out of the midst of the fire.

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V23">23&nbsp;</span> Now when you heard the voice from the midst of the fire (the mountain indeed was burning with fire) you came to me, even all the leaders of your tribes, and your elders,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V25">25&nbsp;</span> Now therefore let us not die, for this great fire will consume us, if we continue any longer to hear the voice of the Lord our God; and we shall die.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V26">26&nbsp;</span> For what mortal, who hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, can live.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V27">27&nbsp;</span> Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God may say, and thou shalt rehearse to us all that the Lord our God may speak to thee, and we will hear and do it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V28">28&nbsp;</span> And the Lord heard the sound of your words when you spoke to me. And the Lord said to me, I have heard the sound of the words of this people, even all that they have spoken to thee. All that they have said is right.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V29">29&nbsp;</span> O that they may have their heart so disposed in them as to fear me, and to keep my commandments continually, that it may be well with them, and their children for ever.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V30">30&nbsp;</span> Go say to them, Return to your houses.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V31">31&nbsp;</span> But as for thee, Stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all the commandments, and the rules of rectitude, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them; and let them act accordingly in the land which I give them for a possession.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V32">32&nbsp;</span> Be careful therefore to do as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee. Turn not aside to the right, nor to the left,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V33">33&nbsp;</span> from walking in all the way which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that he may give thee rest, and that it may be well with thee, and that you may live long in the land, of which you shall take possession.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V3">3&nbsp;</span> nor contract marriages with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V4">4&nbsp;</span> For she will cause thy son to apostatise from me, and to serve other gods, and the Lord will be provoked to wrath against you, and speedily destroy thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V5">5&nbsp;</span> But in this manner thou shalt deal with them? their altars you shall destroy; their pillars you shall break to pieces; their groves you shall cut down; and the graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V6">6&nbsp;</span> For thou art a people dedicated to the Lord thy God, and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be a peculiar people to himself, in preference to all the nations which are on the face of the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V7">7&nbsp;</span> It was not because you were the most numerous of all the nations, that the Lord preferred you, and made choice of you; for you are the fewest of all the nations:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V8">8&nbsp;</span> but because the Lord loved you, therefore in performance of the oath which he swore to your fathers, the Lord led you out with a strong hand, and the Lord redeemed thee from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V9">9&nbsp;</span> Know therefore that the Lord thy God is the only God; the God to be confided in, who keepeth covenant and mercy for thousands of generations with them who love him, and keep his commandments;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V10">10&nbsp;</span> and who requiteth to their face them who hate him, so as to destroy them. To them indeed who hate him he will not be slack; to their face he will requite them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V11">11&nbsp;</span> Therefore keep the commandments, and the rules of rectitude, and these judgments, which I this day command thee to do.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V12">12&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass, that if you hearken to these rules, and keep and practise them, the Lord thy God will keep with thee the covenant, and the mercy, which he, with an oath, confirmed to your fathers.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V13">13&nbsp;</span> And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the offspring of thy womb, and the product of thy land; thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, thy herds of cattle, and thy flocks of sheep, in the land which he, with an oath, promised thy fathers to give thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V14">14&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt be blessed above all the nations. There shall not be a male without a progeny, nor a female barren among you, or your cattle.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V15">15&nbsp;</span> And the Lord will remove from thee every malady, and will not lay upon thee any of the sore diseases of Egypt, which thou hast seen, which thou hast known: but will lay them upon all that hate thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V16">16&nbsp;</span> And thou shalt consume all the spoils of the nations, which the Lord thy God giveth thee: Thine eye shall not have pity on them. And thou shalt not perform religious service to their gods; for this is a snare for thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V17">17&nbsp;</span> Now if thou shouldst say in thy heart, This nation is stronger than I; how shall I be able to exterminate them?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V18">18&nbsp;</span> Be not afraid of them; but keep up a lively remembrance of all that the Lord thy God did to Pharao, and to all the Egyptians;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V19">19&nbsp;</span> the great trials which thine eyes have seen,; the signs and great wonders; the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm; As the Lord thy God brought thee out, so will the Lord your God deal with all the nations, of whom you are afraid.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V20">20&nbsp;</span> The Lord thy God will indeed send hornets against them, until they who are left, and hid from thee, are utterly destroyed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V21">21&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for the Lord thy God; the Great and Mighty God, is with thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V22">22&nbsp;</span> The Lord thy God will indeed consume those nations from before thee, by little and little. Thou wilt not be enabled to destroy them at once, lest the land become a waste, and the wild beasts multiply against thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V23">23&nbsp;</span> But the Lord thy God will deliver them into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy them with a great destruction, until you may utterly exterminate them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V24">24&nbsp;</span> When he shall deliver their kings into your hands, you shall destroy their name out of that place. None shall be able to stand before thee, until thou hast utterly destroyed them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V25">25&nbsp;</span> The graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire. Thou shalt not covet the silver nor the gold thereof. Thou shalt not take any of it for thyself, lest thou be ensnared by it. Because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V26">26&nbsp;</span> therefore thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house; for thou wilt be an Anathema as well as it. Thou shalt utterly detest it, and hold it in utter abomination; for it is an Anathema, a devoted thing.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V1">1&nbsp;</span> All the commands which I this day give you in charge you shall be careful to perform, that you may live, and be multiplied, and go in, and possess the land which the Lord your God solemnly promised to your fathers;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V2">2&nbsp;</span> and thou shalt keep in remembrance all the way which the Lord thy God led thee in the wilderness, that he might afflict thee, and prove thee, and know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or not.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V3">3&nbsp;</span> And when he had afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, then he fed thee with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might shew thee, that man can live not on bread only; but that man can live on any thing which God is pleased to appoint.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V4">4&nbsp;</span> Thy garments did not become too old for thee, nor were thy shoes worn out from under thee; nor the feet galled during the whole forty years;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V7">7&nbsp;</span> For the Lord thy God will bring thee to a good, and extensive land, where there are brooks of water, and fountains from the deeps, issuing forth from the plains, and from the hills;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V8">8&nbsp;</span> a land of wheat, and barley, where there are vineyards, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil-olive and honey;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V9">9&nbsp;</span> a land wherein thou shalt eat bread, without scarcity, and in which thou shalt not want any thing; a land, the stones of which are iron, and out of the mountains of which thou shalt dig brass.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V14">14&nbsp;</span> be not elated in heart, nor forget the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V15">15&nbsp;</span> who conducted you through that great and frightful wilderness, where there were biting serpents and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought a fountain of water for thee out of a flinty rock;</div>

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">9</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V1">1&nbsp;</span> Hear, Israel! Thou art now about to cross the Jordan, to go in to possess nations much greater and stronger than you, large cities, which are walled up to the sky,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V2">2&nbsp;</span> a people great and numerous, and of great stature, the children of Enak, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard it said, Who can stand before the sons of Enak?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V3">3&nbsp;</span> Know therefore this day, that the Lord thy God will himself march before thee. He is a consuming fire. He will destroy them. He will cause them to turn back from before thy face, and will destroy them speedily, as the Lord hath said to thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V4">4&nbsp;</span> Now when the Lord thy God hath destroyed those nations from before thee, speak not in thy heart, saying, On the account of my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this good land. It is not on the account of thy righteousness, nor for the sanctity of thy heart, that thou goest in to possess their land; but, because of the wickedness of those nations, the Lord will drive them out from before thee,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V5">5&nbsp;</span> and that he may establish his covenant which the Lord made with our fathers; with Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V6">6&nbsp;</span> Know therefore this day, that it is not for thy righteousness that the Lord thy God giveth thee that good land for a possession; for thou art a stiffnecked people.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V7">7&nbsp;</span> Remember; never forget how often thou hast provoked to wrath the Lord thy God, in the wilderness. From the day you came out of Egypt, till your coming to this place, you have gone on in a course of rebellion against the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V8">8&nbsp;</span> At Choreb you provoked the Lord, so that the anger of the Lord was kindled against you, to destroy you utterly.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V9">9&nbsp;</span> When I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone; the tables of the covenant which the Lord had made with you. Now I was on the mount forty days, and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V10">10&nbsp;</span> and the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, written with the finger of God: upon them indeed were written all the words which the Lord had spoken to you at the mount, on the day of the solemn assembly.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V11">11&nbsp;</span> And after the forty days, and the forty nights, when the Lord gave me the two tables of stone; the tables of the covenant,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V12">12&nbsp;</span> the Lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly from this place: for thy people, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt, have transgressed. They have gone aside quickly out of the way, to which thou didst enjoin them, and have made for themselves a molten image.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V13">13&nbsp;</span> Moreover the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have spoken to thee once and again and said, I have seen this people, and behold it is a stiffnecked people;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V14">14&nbsp;</span> now therefore let me utterly destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make thee a nation, great and powerful, and much more numerous than this.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V15">15&nbsp;</span> Whereupon I turned, and came down from the mount. Now the mount was blazing with fire up to heaven, and I had in my two hands the two tables of the testimonies.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V16">16&nbsp;</span> And when I saw that you had sinned before the Lord your God, and that you had made for yourselves a molten image, and had turned aside from the way in which the Lord had commanded you to walk;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V17">17&nbsp;</span> having hold of the two tables, I threw them out of my hands and broke them before your eyes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V18">18&nbsp;</span> Then I made supplication before the Lord, a second time, as I had done before, forty days and forty nights; (I neither ate bread nor drank water); for your sins which you had committed by doing evil in the sight of the Lord God, to provoke him to wrath.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V19">19&nbsp;</span> Even now I tremble on account of the wrath and indignation. For the anger of the Lord was kindled against you, to destroy you utterly. But the Lord hearkened to me at that time also.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V20">20&nbsp;</span> Even against Aaron, his wrath was kindled to destroy him; But I prayed for Aaron also at that time.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V21">21&nbsp;</span> Now I had taken your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire; and having stamped, and ground it, till it was very fine, and like dust, I threw the dust into the torrent which ran down out of the mount.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V22">22&nbsp;</span> At Burning also, and at Temptation, and at Monuments of longing desire, you provoked the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V23">23&nbsp;</span> And when the Lord sent you from Kades-barne, saying, Go up, and take possession of the land which I give you, you disobeyed the command of the Lord your God, and did not confide in him, nor hearken to his voice.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V24">24&nbsp;</span> You have been disobedient to the commands of the Lord, from the day he made himself known to you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V25">25&nbsp;</span> When I was making supplication before the Lord, forty days, and forty nights, as I had done before (for the Lord spoke of destroying you utterly,)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V26">26&nbsp;</span> I prayed to God, and said, O Lord, thou king of all the gods, destroy not thy people, and thy heritage, whom thou hast redeemed, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with thy mighty power, and with thy strong hand, and with thine outstretched arm.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V27">27&nbsp;</span> Remember Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thyself. Look not upon the stubbornness of this people, nor upon their wickedness, and their sins,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V28">28&nbsp;</span> lest they who dwell in the land, out of which thou hast brought them, should speak, saying, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them; and because he hated them, he led them out into the wilderness to kill them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C9V29">29&nbsp;</span> Now these are thy people, and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with thy mighty power, and with thy strong hand, and with thine outstretched arm.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V1">1&nbsp;</span> At that time the Lord said to me, Hew thee out two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mount; and thou shalt make thee an ark of wood,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V2">2&nbsp;</span> and thou shalt write on these tables the words which were on the first tables, which thou didst break, and shalt put them in the ark.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V3">3&nbsp;</span> So when I had made an ark of incorruptible wood, and hewed two tables of stone, like the first, and had gone up the mount with the two tables in my hand;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V4">4&nbsp;</span> and he had written on these tables, according to the former writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spoke to you at the mount, out of the midst of the fire; and the Lord had given them to me,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thence they removed to Gadgad, and from Gadgad to Etabatha, a land abounding with streams of water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V8">8&nbsp;</span> Now the Lord, having at that time set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord, and to serve, and bless in his name, as they do at this day,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V10">10&nbsp;</span> When I had been on the mount forty days, and forty nights, the Lord hearkened to me at that time also, for the Lord was not willing to destroy you utterly;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V11">11&nbsp;</span> and the Lord said to me, Go, march before this people, and let them go in, and take possession of the land which I solemnly promised their fathers to give them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V12">12&nbsp;</span> Now therefore, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C10V13">13&nbsp;</span> to keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and his rules of rectitude, which I this day command thee, that it may be well with thee?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V2">2&nbsp;</span> And this is the ordinance touching this release. Thou shalt remit every private debt which thy neighbour oweth thee, and shalt not demand it of thy brother; for the release for the Lord thy God is proclaimed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V3">3&nbsp;</span> Of a stranger thou mayst demand what may be due to thee from him; but to a brother thou shalt make a release of what he oweth thee,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V4">4&nbsp;</span> because among you there is to be none in want; because the Lord thy God will, with blessing, bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, that you may possess it,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V10">10&nbsp;</span> Thou shalt surely give him, and lend him freely, what he is in want of, according to his necessity.

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V18">18&nbsp;</span> It shall not seem hard to thee that they are let go free from thee; for they have saved thee the wages of an hireling. He hath served thee six years. When the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all thou doest,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C15V19">19&nbsp;</span> every firstling of thy herds, and thy flocks, even all the males, thou shalt dedicate to the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not work a firstling bull, nor shear the firstlings of thy flock.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V1">1&nbsp;</span> These were the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to state to the children of Israel, in the land of Moab, over and above the covenant which he had made with them at Choreb.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V2">2&nbsp;</span> Then Moses called all the sons of Israel, and said to them, You have seen all the things which the Lord did in Egypt, before your eyes, to Pharao and his servants, and all his land;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V3">3&nbsp;</span> those great trials which your eyes have seen, those signs, and those great wonders.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V4">4&nbsp;</span> Now hath not the Lord God given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, even at this day?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V5">5&nbsp;</span> When he led you forty years in the wilderness, your clothes did not grow too old, nor were your shoes worn out from your feet.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V6">6&nbsp;</span> You did not eat bread, nor drink wine, nor strong drink, that you might know that the Lord lam is your God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V7">7&nbsp;</span> And when you came to this place, and Seon, king of Esebon, and Og king of Basan, came out to meet us in battle, we smote them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V8">8&nbsp;</span> and took their land, and I have given it to Reuben, and Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasses:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V9">9&nbsp;</span> you shall therefore be careful to perform all the words of this covenant. In order that you might fully comprehend all that you are to do,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V10">10&nbsp;</span> you have this day stood, all of you, before the Lord your God, the chiefs of your tribes, and your senate, and your judges, and your officers, every man of Israel,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V11">11&nbsp;</span> your wives, and your children, and the stranger who is in your camp, from the hewer of wood to the drawer of water,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V12">12&nbsp;</span> to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God, and into the curses which the Lord thy God this day stateth to thee,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V13">13&nbsp;</span> that he may establish thee a people for himself. So he himself will be thy God, as he said to thee, and as he hath sworn to thy fathers, Abraham, and Isaak, and Jacob.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V14">14&nbsp;</span> Now I make this covenant, and this oath, not with you only,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V15">15&nbsp;</span> but both with those who are here this day, with you before the Lord your God, and with those who are not here with you this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V16">16&nbsp;</span> Inasmuch as you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and have seen, as we passed through the nations, through which you passed,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V17">17&nbsp;</span> their abominations and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are among them;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V18">18&nbsp;</span> is there any man among you, or any woman, or family, or tribe, whose understanding hath turned them from the Lord your God, to go and serve the gods of those nations? Is there any such root among you, springing up for gall and bitterness?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V19">19&nbsp;</span> Now in case any one shall hear the words of this curse, and bless himself in his heart, saying, Good luck betide me! I will walk in the error of my own heart, that the sinner may not involve the guiltless in ruin with himself.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V20">20&nbsp;</span> God will not be propitious to him, but most assuredly the anger of the Lord, and his indignation, will then be kindled against that man; and all the curses of this covenant, which are written in this book, shall cleave to him; and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V21">21&nbsp;</span> The Lord will indeed separate him, from all the children of Israel, according to all the curses of this covenant, which are written in this book of the law.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V22">22&nbsp;</span> And when the generations to come; your children who shall rise up after you, and the stranger who may come from a far distant country, will say; when they shall see the plagues of that land, and the diseases thereof, which the Lord hath sent upon it;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V23">23&nbsp;</span> brimstone and burnt salt; when through the whole land there shall be no sowing; no natural productions, no verdure on it, a destruction like that of Sodom and Gomorra, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord overthrew with wrath and indignation;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V24">24&nbsp;</span> When all the nations shall say, Why hath the Lord dealt thus with this land? What hath occasioned this great fierceness of indignation?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V25">25&nbsp;</span> Then they will say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V26">26&nbsp;</span> and went and served strange gods, which they did not know, and which he had not arranged for them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V27">27&nbsp;</span> therefore the Lord was provoked to wrath against this land, to bring upon it all the curses which are written in the book of the law;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V28">28&nbsp;</span> and the Lord rooted them out from their land, with wrath, and anger, and very great indignation, and cast them out into another land, as at this day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V29">29&nbsp;</span> The things which are secret are for the Lord our God; but the things which are manifest are for us and our children forever, that we may perform all the words of this law;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V1">1&nbsp;</span> When Moses had finished speaking all these words, to all the children of Israel,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V2">2&nbsp;</span> he said to them, I am now a hundred and twenty years old. I shall no more be able to go out, and come in before you: for the Lord hath said to me, Thou shalt not cross the Jordan.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V3">3&nbsp;</span> The Lord thy God, who goeth before thee, will himself drive out those nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them; and Joshua is to go before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V4">4&nbsp;</span> The Lord thy God will indeed do to them as he did to Seon, and Og, the two kings of the Amorites, who were on this side the Jordan, and to their land; in the same manner as the Lord rooted them out,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V5">5&nbsp;</span> and delivered them up to you. And you shall do to them as I have commanded you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V6">6&nbsp;</span> Act manfully, and be strong; fear not, nor be faint hearted, nor terrified at them; for the Lord thy God, who goeth before you, is with you; is among you. May he never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V7">7&nbsp;</span> Then Moses called Joshua, and said to him before all Israel, Be courageous, and strong; for thou shalt go before this people, into the land which the Lord solemnly promised your fathers to give them; and thou shalt put them in possession of it;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V8">8&nbsp;</span> and the Lord, who marcheth with thee, will not leave thee nor forsake thee. Fear not, nor be dismayed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V9">9&nbsp;</span> Now Moses had written the words of this law in a book; so he gave it to the priests, the children of Levi, who carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to the elders of the children of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V10">10&nbsp;</span> And Moses gave them a charge on that day saying, At the end of every seven years, at the Solemnity of the release, during the festival of tabernacles,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V13">13&nbsp;</span> And let their children who have not known, hearken, and learn to fear the Lord thy God, all the days they live in the land to which you are going, to cross the Jordan, there to take possession of it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V14">14&nbsp;</span> Now when the Lord said to Moses, Behold the time of thy death approacheth, call Joshua, and stand at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony, and I will give him a charge; thereupon Moses went with Joshua to the tabernacle of the testimony, and they stood at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V15">15&nbsp;</span> and the Lord descended in a cloud, and stood at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony, and while the pillar of the cloud stood at the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V16">16&nbsp;</span> the Lord said to Moses, Behold when thou sleepest with thy fathers, this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land to which they are going. And when they forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V17">17&nbsp;</span> I shall be provoked to wrath against them that day, and I will leave them, and turn away my face from them, and they shall be devoured. And when many evils and afflictions shall befal them, then will one say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these evils have befallen me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V18">18&nbsp;</span> But I will turn away my face from them, on that day, because of all their wickedness which they have committed, because they have turned to strange gods.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V19">19&nbsp;</span> Now therefore write the words of this Ode and teach it to the children of Israel, and put it into their mouth, that this Ode may be an open witness for me among the children of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V20">20&nbsp;</span> For when I bring them into that good land, which I solemnly promised their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat, and be satiated, and they will turn to strange gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V21">21&nbsp;</span> but this Ode will rise up, and witness against them; for it shall never be forgotten out of their mouth, nor out of the mouth of their seed: for I know their wickedness, what they do even now before I have brought them into that good land which I solemnly promised their fathers.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V22">22&nbsp;</span> So Moses wrote the Ode that day and taught it to the children of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V23">23&nbsp;</span> And the Lord gave a charge to Joshua, and said, Be courageous, and strong, for thou shalt conduct the children of Israel into the land which the Lord solemnly promised them, and he will be with thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V24">24&nbsp;</span> Now when Moses had made an end of writing all the words of this law in a book, even to the close,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V25">25&nbsp;</span> he gave a charge to the Levites, who carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V26">26&nbsp;</span> Take this book of the law; and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God; and it shall be there for a witness against thee;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V27">27&nbsp;</span> for I know thy contentious disposition, and thy stiff neck. For even now while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against God; how then can it be otherwise after my death?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V28">28&nbsp;</span> Assemble before me the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your under officers, that I may speak in their hearing all these words and call heaven and earth to witness against them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V29">29&nbsp;</span> For I know that after my death you will commit iniquity, and turn aside out of the way which I commanded you, and evils will befal you in the latter days, because you will do evil before the Lord, to provoke him to wrath by the works of your hands.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C31V30">30&nbsp;</span> Then for a conclusion Moses spoke in the hearing of all the congregation the words of this Ode.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V9">9&nbsp;</span> And the Lord's portion was his people Jacob; Israel was his lot of inheritance.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V10">10&nbsp;</span> He sustained them in the wilderness, In the drought of heat, in a land without water. He led them about, and instructed them; He kept them as the apple of his eye.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V11">11&nbsp;</span> As an eagle would defend his nest, And, when anxious for his young, would spread out his wings, and receive them, And bare them up on his shoulders;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V13">13&nbsp;</span> He brought them up to the strength of this land, He fed them with the products of the fields; They sucked honey out of a rock, And oil out of a flinty rock;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V35">35&nbsp;</span> In the day of vengeance I will requite, When their foot shall be supplanted. Because the day of destruction is nigh for them, Therefore at hand are the things prepared for you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V36">36&nbsp;</span> Because the Lord will judge his people; When he shall be appeased for his servants, (For he saw that they were enfeebled, Made faint by hostile invasions and dejected)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V37">37&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord said, where are their gods; The gods in which they placed their confidence?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V38">38&nbsp;</span> The fat of whose sacrifices you ate And drank the wine of their libations? Let them arise and help you, And let them be your protectors.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V39">39&nbsp;</span> See! See! that I am the Self existent, And that there is no God besides me; I kill, and I can cause to live, I can smite and I can heal, And none can rescue out of my hand:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V40">40&nbsp;</span> For I can lift up my hand to heaven, And swear by my right hand, and say, as I live forever,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V41">41&nbsp;</span> I will make my sword sharp as lightning, And my hand will support judgment; And I will execute vengeance on mine enemies, And make retribution to them who hate me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V42">42&nbsp;</span> I will make my arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall devour flesh With the blood of slain and captives. From the head of enemy chiefs.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V43">43&nbsp;</span> Rejoice, heavens, with him, And let all the angels of God worship him: Rejoice, nations, with his people, And let all the children of God rely on him: For he avengeth the blood of his children, And will judge, and execute vengeance on his enemies, To them who hate him he will render retribution, And the Lord will purify the land of his people.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V44">44&nbsp;</span> Now on that day when Moses had written this Ode and taught it to the children of Israel; and he, and Joshua the son of Nave, had come, and spoken all the words of this law in the hearing of the people,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V45">45&nbsp;</span> Moses concluded his speech to all Israel with this address to them:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V46">46&nbsp;</span> Attend with your heart to all these words which I this day testify to you, and which you are to give in charge to your children, that they may keep, and perform all the words of this law;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V47">47&nbsp;</span> for this is not a vain thing for you; for it is your life; and, for the sake of this word, you shall prolong your days in the land to which you are going, to cross the Jordan to take possession.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V48">48&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord spoke to Moses that day, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V49">49&nbsp;</span> Go up the mountain Abarim, to that mount Nabo, which is in the land of Moab, fronting Jericho, and take a view of the land of Chanaan, which I give to the children of Israel;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V50">50&nbsp;</span> and die on the mount to which thou goest up, and be gathered to thy people, in the same manner as thy brother Aaron died on mount Or, and was gathered to his people,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V51">51&nbsp;</span> because you disobeyed my word among the children of Israel, at the water of strife, at Kades, in the wilderness of Sin.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C32V52">52&nbsp;</span> Because you did not hallow me among the children of Israel, thou shalt see the land at a distance, but shalt not go in thither.</div>
