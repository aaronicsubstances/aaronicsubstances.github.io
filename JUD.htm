They are destroyed in these things that they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason.  <span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&#160;</span>Woe to them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in Korah’s rebellion.  <span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&#160;</span>These are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;  <span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&#160;</span>wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.  <span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&#160;</span>About these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold,<a href="#C1FN3" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></a> the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,  <span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&#160;</span>to execute judgement on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”  <span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&#160;</span>These are murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts—and their mouth speaks proud things—showing respect of persons to gain advantage. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&#160;</span>But you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&#160;</span>They said to you, “In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.”  <span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&#160;</span>These are those who cause divisions and are sensual, not having the Spirit. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&#160;</span>But you, beloved, keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&#160;</span>Keep yourselves in God’s love, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="C1V22">22&#160;</span>On some have compassion, making a distinction,  <span class="verse" id="C1V23">23&#160;</span>and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C1V24">24&#160;</span>Now to him who is able to keep them<a href="#C1FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> TR and NU read “you”</span></a> from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy,  <span class="verse" id="C1V25">25&#160;</span>to God our Saviour, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever.
