<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> A vision which Esaias son of Amos saw, (which he saw respecting Judea and Jerusalem) in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham and Achaz and Hezekias, who reigned over Judea.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> Hearken, heaven! and hear earth! what the Lord hath spoken. I have begotten children and brought them up; and they have rebelled against me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel did not know me. And this people have not regarded me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> Ah! sinful nation; people full of sins! vile race! iniquitous children! you have utterly forsaken the Lord; and provoked to wrath the Holy One of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> What! must you persisting in iniquity be smitten still more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> from the feet to the head, there is no soundness therein. Is it not, here a wound, there a bruise, there a putrefying sore? there is no applying poultice, nor oil, nor bandages.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> Your land is a desert: your cities are burnt with fire. As for your country, before your eyes strangers are devouring it; and it is laid waste, being subdued by foreign tribes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> Must the daughter of Sion be left as a shed in a vineyard: and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers; as a city taken by siege?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> Had not the Lord of Hosts left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and made like Gomorra.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> Hear a word of the Lord, chiefs of Sodom! Attend to the law of God, ye people of Gomorra!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> What is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord: I am cloyed with whole burnt offerings of rams: in the fat of lambs and the blood of bulls and goats I have no delight;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> nor should you come to appear before me: for who hath required these at your hands? You shall no more be admitted to tread my court.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> Though you bring fine flour; it is a vain incense: it is an abomination to me. Your new moons and sabbaths and great day I cannot endure:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> your fasting and cessation from labour; and your new moons and your festivals my soul hateth. You are become loathsome to me; I will no longer remit your sins.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> When you stretch forth your hands, I will turn mine eyes from you: and though you multiply prayer, I will not hearken to you: for your hands are full of blood.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> Wash and become clean: remove iniquities from your souls; in my presence, cease from your evil deeds;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> learn to do good; seek judgment; deliver him who is injured; administer justice to the orphan, and plead the cause of the widow:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&nbsp;</span> then come: (let our controversy be brought to issue, saith the Lord) and though your sins be as a purple stain; I will make you white as snow; though they be as a stain of scarlet; I will make you white as wool.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&nbsp;</span> If you indeed be willing and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&nbsp;</span> but if you refuse and hearken not to me, the sword shall devour you; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these words.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&nbsp;</span> How is the faithful city become a harlot? Sion that was full of justice! In it righteousness made its abode; but now murderers.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V22">22&nbsp;</span> Your silver is not pure: thy vintners mix the wine with water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V23">23&nbsp;</span> The chiefs are rebellious; associates of thieves: they love gifts; they seek rewards: to orphans they do not administer justice; and to the cause of widows they do not attend.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V24">24&nbsp;</span> Therefore thus saith the sovereign Lord of hosts. Alas for the rulers of Israel; for my wrath against these adversaries shall not abate. On these enemies of mine I will execute judgment:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V25">25&nbsp;</span> and I will bring my hand over thee, and purify thee with fire. Them who are disobedient I will destroy; and I will take away from thee all transgressors,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V26">26&nbsp;</span> and establish thy judges as at the first: and thy counsellors as at the beginning: and after these things thou shalt be called The city of Righteousness, the faithful metropolis, Sion.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V27">27&nbsp;</span> For in the exercise of judgment her captivity shall be saved: and in the exercise of mercy,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V28">28&nbsp;</span> the lawless and sinful shall be crushed together; and they who have forsaken the Lord shall be utterly destroyed:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V29">29&nbsp;</span> for they shall be exposed to shame for the idols on which they doted; as they have been for the gardens which they desired.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V30">30&nbsp;</span> For they shall be like an ilex, which hath shed its leaves; and like a garden which hath no water:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V31">31&nbsp;</span> and their strength shall be like tow; and their works like sparks of fire: and the lawless and sinful shall be burned up together; and there shall be no extinguisher.</div>

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">2</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> The word which came to Esaias, son of Amos concerning Judea and concerning Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> Because in the last days, the mount of the Lord will be conspicuous; and the house of God will be on the top of mountains; and exalted above the hills: therefore all the nations will come to it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> Many nations indeed, will go saying, Come, let us go up to the mount of the Lord; and to the house of the God of Jacob. And he will teach us his way, and we will walk therein. For from Sion shall go forth a law; and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> And he will judge among the nations; and work conviction in many a people: and they shall beat their swords into plough shares; and their spears into pruning hooks: and nation shall not lift up a sword against nation; nor shall they learn war any more.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> Now therefore, O house of Jacob; come, let us walk in the light of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> For he hath forgiven his people, the house of Israel Because their land was filled as at first with divinations; like that of the Philistines and many strange children were born to them;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> for their country was filled with silver and gold, and there was no counting their treasures; and their land was filled with horses, and there was no end to their chariots;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> and the land was filled with abominations, the workmanship of their own hands; and they worshipped the things which their fingers had made,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> and the commoner bowed down and the noble humbled himself; therefore I will not forgive them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> Now therefore go into the rocks and hide yourselves in the earth, from the tremendous presence of the Lord; and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise, to crush the land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> For the eyes of the Lord are lofty; but man is low; and the loftiness of these men shall be humbled; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> For the day of the Lord of hosts is against every scorner and haughty man; and against every one high and lofty, and they shall be humbled:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> even against every of those high towering cedars of Lebanon; and against every oak of Basan;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V14">14&nbsp;</span> and against every lofty mountain; and against every hill that is high;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V15">15&nbsp;</span> and against every stately tower; and against every high raised wall;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V16">16&nbsp;</span> and against every ship of the sea; and against every ensign of beauteous ships:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V17">17&nbsp;</span> and every man shall be humbled; and the haughtiness of these men shall fall; and the Lord (Jehovah) alone shall be exalted in that day.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V18">18&nbsp;</span> Then will they hide all these handiworks,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V19">19&nbsp;</span> carrying them into caverns and clefts of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, from the tremendous presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to crush the lands.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V20">20&nbsp;</span> For on that day men will cast to the bats their abominations both of silver and gold, which they made to worship vanities;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V21">21&nbsp;</span> that they may go into holes of the flinty rock: nay into the very clefts of the rock, from the tremendous presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to crush the land.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V1">1&nbsp;</span> Behold now the Sovereign Lord of hosts will remove, from Jerusalem and from Judea, all stay and support of every kind; the stay of bread and the stay of water;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> the giant and mighty man and warrior; judge and prophet; instructor and elder;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> the captain of fifty, and honourable counsellor; the skilful architect and intelligent scholar:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> and I will make boys their princes; and scorners shall rule over them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> And upon one another the people will fall foul, and jostle every man against his neighbour; the boy against the elder and the base against the honourable.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> Because a man will take hold of his brother, or the head of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing be thou our leader, and let me be supplied with food under thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V7">7&nbsp;</span> Therefore on that day he will answer and say, I will not be thy leader, for in my house there is neither bread nor raiment, I will not be the leader of this people.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> Because Jerusalem is forsaken and Judea is fallen therefore their tongues concur with their transgression. They disbelieve the things relating to the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V9">9&nbsp;</span> Because their glory is now humbled; and the shame of their countenance is risen up against them: their sin therefore, like the Sodomites, they proclaimed and openly avowed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V10">10&nbsp;</span> Alas for their souls! Because they have counselled an evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the just one, for he is disagreeable to us; let them therefore eat the fruits of their deeds.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V11">11&nbsp;</span> Alas for the wicked! according to the works of his hands evils shall befal him. my people!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V12">12&nbsp;</span> your task masters glean you; and exactors tyrannize over you. O my people! They who call you happy lead you astray; and disturb the path of your feet.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V14">14&nbsp;</span> The Lord will himself come to a trial with the elders of the people and with their chiefs: Why have you burned up my vineyard? And why is the plunder of the poor in your houses?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V16">16&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty and have walked with outstretched neck and wanton eyes, trailing with them in their gait flowing robes, and moving in set pace with their feet;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V17">17&nbsp;</span> therefore God will humble the princely daughters of Sion and the Lord will expose their form to view.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V18">18&nbsp;</span> On that day the Lord will take away the finery of their attire, the cauls and the curls and the crescents,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V25">25&nbsp;</span> And thy son the most beautiful whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your mighty men shall fall by the sword and be laid low;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V1">1&nbsp;</span> Let me sing for the Beloved, a song of my Beloved to His vineyard. The beloved had a vineyard on a mountain in a rich soil,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V2">2&nbsp;</span> and I hedged it around and trenched it; and planted it with the vine of Sorek; and in the midst of it built a tower, and hewed out therein a wine lake; and waited for its producing grapes, and it produced poisonous berries.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V3">3&nbsp;</span> Now therefore, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V4">4&nbsp;</span> What more could I do for my vineyard that I have not done for it? Because I expected that it would produce grapes, and it hath produced poisonous berries;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V5">5&nbsp;</span> now therefore I will tell you, what I purpose to do with my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be exposed to plunder; and I will demolish its wall, and it shall be for a common walk;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V6">6&nbsp;</span> and I will abandon my vineyard that it may neither be pruned nor digged; and brambles shall overrun it as a waste; and I will give a charge to the clouds not to shed rain upon it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V7">7&nbsp;</span> For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel; and the men of Juda his beloved plant. I waited for their executing justice, but they committed injustice, and promoted not righteousness, but an outcry.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V8">8&nbsp;</span> Woe unto them who join house to house, and who are bringing field nearer to field, that they may take something from their neighbour. Are you alone to dwell in the land?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V9">9&nbsp;</span> For these things have come to the ears of the Lord of Hosts. For though there be many houses they shall be for desolation; though great and fair, there shall be no inhabitants therein.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V10">10&nbsp;</span> For the ground Worked by ten yoke of oxen will not yield a bath of wine; and he who soweth six measures shall not raise three.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V11">11&nbsp;</span> Woe to them, who rise early to follow strong drink, and continue at it till late at night; for the wine will inflame them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V12">12&nbsp;</span> For with kithara and psaltery, tabors and pipes, they drink wine; but they regard not the works of the Lord, nor consider the operations of his hands.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V24">24&nbsp;</span> For this cause, as stubble will be set on fire by a coal, and consumed by a neglected flame; their root shall be like touch wood, and their blossom shall ascend like dust: for they desired not the law of the Lord of Hosts: but provoked to wrath the manifestion of the Holy One of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V25">25&nbsp;</span> Wherefore the Lord of Hosts was incensed against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and smote them: and the mountains were convulsed, and their carcasses were as dung in the high way: and for all this his anger was not turned away; but still his hand is high.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V26">26&nbsp;</span> Therefore he will erect a standard among the nations far off, and summon them from the extremity of the earth; and behold! with speed they are coming swiftly.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V27">27&nbsp;</span> They will not hunger, nor will they be weary: they will not slumber, nor lie down to sleep; nor shall their girdles be loosed from their loins, nor the latchets of their sandals broken.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V1">1&nbsp;</span> In the year in which Ozias the king died I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; and the house was filled with his glory.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V2">2&nbsp;</span> And seraphs stood around him, each having six wings; and with two they covered the face, and with two they covered the feet, and two they used in flying.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V3">3&nbsp;</span> And they cried one to another and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is filled with his glory.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V4">4&nbsp;</span> And the lintel of the door was shaken with the sound of their cry, and the house was filled with smoke.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V5">5&nbsp;</span> Whereupon I said, Ah! Woe is me! (for I was confounded) for being a man, and having unclean lips; and dwelling among a people of unclean lips, I have seen with mine eyes the king the Lord of Hosts.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V8">8&nbsp;</span> Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? And who will go to this people? And I said, Behold, here am I: send me.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V1">1&nbsp;</span> In the days of Achaz the son of Joatham, the son of Ozias king of Judah, Rasin king of Aram and Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel came up against Jerusalem to war against it, but could not lay close siege to it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V2">2&nbsp;</span> When the house of David was informed that Aram had confederated with Ephraim, the heart of the king and the heart of his people was moved, as a tree in the forest is shaken by the wind.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V3">3&nbsp;</span> Whereupon the Lord said to Esaias, Go out and meet Achaz, thou and Forsaken-jasub thy son, at the pool on the upper road to the fuller's field,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V4">4&nbsp;</span> and thou shalt say to him, Take heed and be quiet; be not terrified, nor let thy soul be dismayed on the account of these two smoaking firebrands: for when my fierce wrath is come I will again heal.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V5">5&nbsp;</span> And as for the son of Aram and the son of Romelias; because they have taken evil counsel, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V6">6&nbsp;</span> Let us go up to Judea and confer with the people and bring them into our measures; and let us make the son of Tabeel king over it,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V7">7&nbsp;</span> thus saith the Lord of hosts. This counsel shall not stand; nor shall it take effect.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V8">8&nbsp;</span> But the head of Aram shall be Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasin; but further, in three score and five years, the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from being a people,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V9">9&nbsp;</span> though Somoron is the head of Ephraim, and the son of Romelias, the head of Somoron, yes though you may not believe nor understand.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V10">10&nbsp;</span> Moreover the Lord proceeded to speak to Achaz saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V11">11&nbsp;</span> Ask thee a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V12">12&nbsp;</span> And Achaz said, I will not ask, nor will I try the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V13">13&nbsp;</span> Thereupon he said, Hear now, house of David, Is it a small matter for you to contend with men? How is it then that you contend with the Lord?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V14">14&nbsp;</span> Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and he shall be called Emmanuel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V15">15&nbsp;</span> Doth this child, before it hath known to chuse good in preference to evil, eat butter and honey,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V16">16&nbsp;</span> because previous to its knowing good or evil it disobeyeth evil to make choice of good? The land indeed which thou fearest on account of these two kings shall be relinquished;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V17">17&nbsp;</span> but God will bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon the house of thy father days which have not yet come. From the day he hath taken Ephraim from Juda he will bring the king of the Assyrians.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V18">18&nbsp;</span> It shall come to pass that at that time the Lord will utter a call to the flies; to that part of them which rule over the river of Egypt; and to the bee which is in the country of the Assyrians;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V19">19&nbsp;</span> and they shall all come into the vallies of this country; and into the holes of the rocks; and into the caves and into every cleft.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V20">20&nbsp;</span> On that day the Lord will shave with that razor; with that which was hired on the bank of the river; with that of the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hair of the feet: and take off the beard.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V21">21&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man will keep a young cow and two sheep;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V22">22&nbsp;</span> and by reason of the abundance he will drink milk; butter and honey will be eaten by every one left in the land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V23">23&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass in that day every where, though there may be a thousand vineyards, each valued at a thousand shekels income: they shall be for briars and thorns.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V24">24&nbsp;</span> With bows and arrows men will resort thither. Because the whole country shall be a waste of briars and thorns,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V25">25&nbsp;</span> therefore every mountain which hath been ploughed will be ploughed, wherever terror could not come; for by reason of the country's being a waste of briars and thorns, it shall be a pasture for sheep and a range for the ox.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V13">13&nbsp;</span> hallow the Lord himself, and let him be thy fear:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V14">14&nbsp;</span> for if thou hast put trust in him he will be to thee a sanctuary, and you shall not run against a stumbling stone, nor as under a falling rock. But as for the houses of Jacob, they are in a trap, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem are in a pit:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V15">15&nbsp;</span> for this cause many among them shall be weak and fall and be trodden down and men will safely approach and take them.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C8V17">17&nbsp;</span> Then will one say, I will wait for God, who hath turned away his face from the house of Jacob; and I will trust in him.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C16V12">12&nbsp;</span> but it will be for the purpose of making thee ashamed. Because Moab had tired himself at the altars, therefore he will go in to the works of his hands; that they may intercede; but they shall not be able to deliver him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C16V13">13&nbsp;</span> This is the decree which the Lord pronounced against Moab, when he spoke.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C16V14">14&nbsp;</span> And now I say, within three years of the years of an hireling the glory of Moab shall be debased with all his abundant wealth; and he shall be left few in number and of no estimation.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C17V8">8&nbsp;</span> and let him no more put confidence in altars, nor in the works of their hands which their fingers have made, nor look to the groves nor to their abominations.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C17V9">9&nbsp;</span> In that day thy cities shall be forsaken, as the Amorites and Evites forsook theirs because of the sons of Israel: and they shall become a desolation.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V7">7&nbsp;</span> and the wealth of all the nations which encamped against Ariel, and all they who are warring against Jerusalem, and all who have been assembled against her, and those distressing her, shall be like one dreaming dreams by night:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V8">8&nbsp;</span> and like men who in sleep are eating and drinking, but when they awake the dream is vain: even as a thirsty man dreameth that he drinketh, and when he waketh he is still athirst, his soul having trusted in a shadow: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, who have warred against mount Sion.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V9">9&nbsp;</span> Be sunk in dejection and stand astonished; be drunk and reel, not with wine nor strong drink;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V11">11&nbsp;</span> all these prophesies will be to you like the words of a book which is sealed: which when they give to a man skilled in letters, saying, Read this: He will say, I cannot read it, for it is sealed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V12">12&nbsp;</span> And should the book be put in the hands of an illiterate man, and they say to him, Read that, he will say, I do not know letters.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C29V16">16&nbsp;</span> Are not you to be considered as the potter's clay? Shall the thing formed say to the former of it, thou hast not made me. Or shall the work say to the workman thou hast not made me wisely?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V12">12&nbsp;</span> Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, because you have disbelieved these words and placed your hopes on a lie: and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this matter;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V13">13&nbsp;</span> therefore this sin shall be to you like the tottering wall of a fortified city, which hath been taken by surprise; the fall of which is instantaneous.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V14">14&nbsp;</span> And its fall shall be like the breaking of an earthen vessel, the fragments of which are so small that there cannot be found among them a sherd on which thou canst carry fire or with which thou canst scoop up a little water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V15">15&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, Lord. The Holy One of Israel, when thou shalt return sighing, then thou shalt be saved, and thou shalt know in what a situation thou wast, when thou didst trust in these vanities. Your strength was vain, yet you would not hearken,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V16">16&nbsp;</span> but said, We will flee on horses. Therefore flee you shall. And, We will mount swift coursers, therefore swift shall be your pursuers.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V18">18&nbsp;</span> But again the Lord will wait to be gracious to you, and will therefore be exalted for compassionating you. Because the Lord your God is judge, happy are they who wait for him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V19">19&nbsp;</span> Because a holy people will dwell in Sion, and Jerusalem with weeping cried, Have mercy upon me. Therefore he will have mercy upon thee. When he heard the sound of thy cry, he hearkened to thee.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V27">27&nbsp;</span> Behold the name of the Lord cometh for a time, a burning wrath. The oracle of his lips with glory is an oracle full of indignation, and the fury of the wrath devoureth like fire;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V28">28&nbsp;</span> and his breath is like a sweeping flood in a valley, which will reach up to the neck and swell to confound nations for their vain errors. When error shall pursue them and overtake them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V29">29&nbsp;</span> before their face ought not you to rejoice continually and continually go to my solemnities like them who are celebrating a festival? Like them who are gladdened you should go with instrumental music to the mount of the Lord, to the God of Israel.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V30">30&nbsp;</span> When the Lord shall cause the glory of his voice to be heard; when, to display the fury of his arm with wrath and indignation and consuming fire, he shall utter tremendous thunder, accompanied with a furious tempest of rain and hail.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V31">31&nbsp;</span> For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be beaten down by the stroke with which he will smite them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V32">32&nbsp;</span> This indeed he shall have from all around him; from every place whence they had a hope of that assistance on which he relied, they will with timbrels and the kithara fight against him, after his rout.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C30V33">33&nbsp;</span> Of thee he will previously demand (and hast thou not provided for his reign) a deep valley and wood laid up in piles; the wrath of the Lord will be fire and wood in abundance like a valley burning with brimstone.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V1">1&nbsp;</span> In the fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias, Sennacherim king of the Assyrians came up against the fortified cities of Judea, and took them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V2">2&nbsp;</span> And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsakes from Lakes to Jerusalem, to king Ezekias, with a great army. And he halted at the canal of the upper pool in the high way to the fuller's field.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V3">3&nbsp;</span> And to him went out Eliakim the son of Chelkias the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joach son of Asaph the recorder.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V4">4&nbsp;</span> And Rabsakes said to them, Tell Ezekias, Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians, On what hast thou placed confidence?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V5">5&nbsp;</span> Notwithstanding negotiation and fair speeches, are not preparations making for war? Now therefore on whom hast thou relied, that thou rebellest against me?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V6">6&nbsp;</span> Behold thy reliance is on that staff; that staff of reed; that broken reed, Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will pierce his hand and go through it. Such is Pharao king of Egypt to all who rely on him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V7">7&nbsp;</span> But if you say, Our confidence is in the Lord our God;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V8">8&nbsp;</span> were you now in close connexion with my master the king of the Assyrians; and were I to give you two thousand horses; could you put riders on them?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V9">9&nbsp;</span> How then can you revolt and affect to be petty princes. Those are reduced to slavery who have trusted in the Egyptians for charioteers and cavalry.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V10">10&nbsp;</span> Besides, are we now come up without the Lord against this land to war against it? The Lord hath said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V11">11&nbsp;</span> Then Eliakim and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to thy servants in Syriac, for we understand it. Therefore speak not to us in the Jewish language. Why speakest thou to the ears of the men on the walls?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V12">12&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Rabsakes said to them, Hath my lord sent me to your lord or to you to speak these words? Was it not to those men; to them who are stationed on that wall, that they may eat dung and drink urine, both they and you together?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V13">13&nbsp;</span> Then Rabsakes stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V14">14&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you with speeches. He cannot deliver you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V15">15&nbsp;</span> and let not Ezekias say to you, God will deliver you; and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V16">16&nbsp;</span> Hearken not to Ezekias. Thus saith the king of the Assyrians, If you wish to be happy, come out to me; and eat, every one, of his own vine and his own fig trees, and drink water from your own cisterns,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V17">17&nbsp;</span> until I come and take you to a land like your own; a land of corn and wine, and of bread and vineyards.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V18">18&nbsp;</span> Let not Ezekias deceive you saying, God will deliver you. Have the gods of the nations, delivered every one his own country out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V19">19&nbsp;</span> Where is the God of Emath and Arphath? And where is the God of the city Eppharuim? Were they able to deliver Samaria out of my hand?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V20">20&nbsp;</span> Who is there of all the gods of the nations who hath delivered his country out of my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V21">21&nbsp;</span> But they were silent and none answered him a word, because the king had given a charge that none should answer.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C36V22">22&nbsp;</span> Then Eliakim the son of Chelkias the steward, and Somnas the secretary at war and Joach the son of Asaph the recorder went to Ezekias with their clothes rent and told him the words of Rabsakes.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V1">1&nbsp;</span> And when Ezekias heard them he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and went up to the house of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V2">2&nbsp;</span> And he sent Eliakim the steward and Somnas the scribe and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth to Esaias son of Amos the prophet with this message to him, Thus saith Ezekias,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V3">3&nbsp;</span> This day is a day of trouble and of reproach and of rebuke and of wrath; for pangs are come on a woman in travail and she hath not strength to bring forth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V4">4&nbsp;</span> That the Lord thy God may attend to the message of Rabsakes which the king of the Assyrians hath sent to reproach the Living God; and refute the words which the Lord thy God hath heard, thou shouldst pray to the Lord for these poor remains.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V5">5&nbsp;</span> So when the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V6">6&nbsp;</span> he said to them, Thus shall you say to your lord, Thus saith the Lord, Be not terrified at the words which thou hast heard; with which the messengers of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V7">7&nbsp;</span> Behold I am about to put such a spirit in him, that he having heard news will return to his own country: and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V8">8&nbsp;</span> So Rabsakes returned and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna, for he heard that he had removed from Lachis;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V9">9&nbsp;</span> and Thoraka king of the Ethiopians came out to give him battle. Upon hearing this, he retreated, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V10">10&nbsp;</span> Thus shall you say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, on whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V11">11&nbsp;</span> Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done? How they have destroyed all the land?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V12">12&nbsp;</span> And shalt thou be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my ancestors destroyed? Either, Goza or Charran or Raphath which are in the country of Theemath?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V13">13&nbsp;</span> Where are the kings of Emath? And where those of Arphath? And where those of the city Eppharuim, of Anagougana?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V14">14&nbsp;</span> When Ezekias received the letter from the messengers and had read it, he went up to the house of the Lord; and having spread it before the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V15">15&nbsp;</span> Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V16">16&nbsp;</span> O Lord of Hosts the God of Israel, who art enthroned on the cherubim! Thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world. Thou hast made the heaven and the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V17">17&nbsp;</span> Incline, Lord, thine ear! Lord, hearken! Open, O Lord, thine eyes! Lord, look down and behold the words of Sennacherim which he hath sent to reproach the Living God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V18">18&nbsp;</span> In truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste this whole inhabited land and the country of those here mentioned</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V19">19&nbsp;</span> and have cast their idols into the fire; for they were not gods; but works of mens' hands, stocks and stones;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V20">20&nbsp;</span> therefore they destroyed them. But now, Lord, our God, save us out of their hands that every kingdom of the earth may know, that thou alone art God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V21">21&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Esaias son of Amos was sent to Ezekias and said to him, Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, I have heard the prayer which thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V22">22&nbsp;</span> This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him, The virgin daughter of Sion hath despised thee and mocked thee; at thee the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V23">23&nbsp;</span> whom hast thou reproached and provoked? Or against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, (without lifting up thine eye to the Holy One of Israel?)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V24">24&nbsp;</span> That by thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord? For thou hast said, By the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended the height of mountains, and to the utmost limits of Libanus, and cut down the lofty cedar and beautiful cypress, and entered the stately part of the forest.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V25">25&nbsp;</span> I have laid bridges and dried up waters and every collection of water</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V26">26&nbsp;</span> Hast thou not heard those things of old which I have done? From ancient times I gave command and have now pointed out to lay waste nations in strong places and them Who dwell in fortified cities.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V27">27&nbsp;</span> I weakened their hands and they were dried up, and became like dry grass on house tops, and like a blasted ear of corn.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V28">28&nbsp;</span> And now I know thy resting place and thy going out and thy coming in. As the rage with which thou hast been inflamed,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V29">29&nbsp;</span> and thy bitterness are come up to me; I will therefore put a hook in thy nose and a bridle in thy jaws; and turn thee back by the way in which thou camest.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V30">30&nbsp;</span> Now this shall be a sign to thee. Eat this year what thou hast sown, and in the second year what is left; but in the third year sow ye and reap; plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V31">31&nbsp;</span> for they who are left shall continue in Judea. They shall strike root downwards and bear fruit upwards.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V32">32&nbsp;</span> For they of Jerusalem shall be left and they of mount Sion shall be saved. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will do this.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V33">33&nbsp;</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord, With regard to the king of the Assyrians, he shall not enter this city; nor shoot an arrow against it; nor present against it a shield; nor enclose it with a rampire</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V34">34&nbsp;</span> But by the way which he came, by the same he shall return; and into this city he shall not come. Thus saith the Lord,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V35">35&nbsp;</span> I will cover this city with my shield to save it for mine own sake and the sake of my servant David.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V36">36&nbsp;</span> So an angel of the Lord went forth and slew of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand. And when they arose in the morning they found all these dead bodies.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V37">37&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Sennacherim king of the Assyrians retreated and went and dwelt in Ninive.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C37V38">38&nbsp;</span> And as he was Worshipping, in his house, Nasarach his ancestor; Adramelech and Sarousar his sons smote him with their swords; and, they having made their escape to Armenia, Asardan his son reigned in his stead.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C43V5">5&nbsp;</span> Fear not. Because I am with thee, from the east I will bring thy seed, and gather thee together from the west:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C43V6">6&nbsp;</span> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep thou not back; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C43V20">20&nbsp;</span> The wild beasts of the field will bless me; the Seirens and the daughters of the ostrich; because I have given water in the wilderness, and flowing streams in the desert, to give drink to this race of mine which I have chosen;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C44V12">12&nbsp;</span> for the carpenter sharpened an axe, with a hatchet he modelled it; then he put it into a lathe and with his strong arm fashioned it. Though he be hungry and faint, he must not drink water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C44V13">13&nbsp;</span> The carpenters having chosen a piece of wood framed it by rule and glued the parts together, and made it in the form of a man and with the comeliness of a man, to set it in a house.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C44V17">17&nbsp;</span> Yet of the residue he made a carve god, and worshippeth it, and prayeth to it, saying, Deliver me, for thou art my God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C44V18">18&nbsp;</span> They had not sense to think; for they were so involved in darkness that they could not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts:</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C44V20">20&nbsp;</span> Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they are led astray and none can deliver his soul. Take a view of it, will you not say, There is indeed a lie in my right hand?</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V2">2&nbsp;</span> and who stay themselves on the name of this holy city, and rely for support on the God of Israel, whose name is the Lord of Hosts. I have already told you former things:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V3">3&nbsp;</span> when they proceeded from my mouth and were published, I did them speedily and they came to pass.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V4">4&nbsp;</span> I know that thou art of an untractable temper, that thy neck is a sinew of iron and thy brow, brass;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V5">5&nbsp;</span> therefore I told thee beforehand what would come upon thee; I published them that thou mightest not say, The idols have done this to me, nor say, The graven or molten images have ordered it for me,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V6">6&nbsp;</span> you have heard all these things, and did not yourselves know them. But now I have made thee hear new things, which shall hereafter come to pass. Yet hast thou not said,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V7">7&nbsp;</span> Things done now and not formerly! Yes, never in former days didst thou hear these things. Thou shouldst not say, Indeed I know them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C48V8">8&nbsp;</span> Thou didst neither know nor didst thou believe, nor did I from the beginning open thine ear: for I knew that, being in rebellion, thou wilt continue to rebel and wilt still be called a transgressor from the womb.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V4">4&nbsp;</span> Whereupon I said, I have laboured in vain; for vanity and for nought I have spent my strength; therefore my cause is with the Lord; and my labour is before my God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V5">5&nbsp;</span> And now thus saith the Lord who formed me from the womb. To be his servant to gather Jacob to him, and Israel. I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord. And my God will be my strength.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V6">6&nbsp;</span> Moreover he said to me, Is it a great thing for thee to be called my servant to reestablish the tribes of Jacob and bring back the dispersion of Israel? Behold I have given thee for the covenant of a race; for the light of nations; that thou mayst be for salvation to the farthest part of the earth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V7">7&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord who delivered thee; the God of Israel, Hallow him who despised his life, him who was abhorred by the nations, the slaves of the Arehons.

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V8">8&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time I have hearkened to thee, and in a day of salvation helped thee; and have formed thee and given thee for the covenant of nations that thou mayst reduce the earth to order and possess desolate heritages,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V9">9&nbsp;</span> saying to them who are in bonds, Go forth; and to them who are in darkness, Come into light. In all the highways they shall be fed, and there shall be pasture for them in all the paths.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V10">10&nbsp;</span> They shall not hunger nor shall they thirst, nor shall the burning wind nor the sun smite them; but he who hath compassion on them will comfort them and lead them to bursting springs of water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V11">11&nbsp;</span> And I will make every mountain a highway, and every path a pasture for them.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V21">21&nbsp;</span> Whereupon thou wilt say in thy heart, Who hath begotten these for me? I indeed was childless and a widow, Who then hath brought up these for me? I was abandoned and alone; whence then have I these?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V22">22&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, Lord, Behold I will lift up my hand to the nations, and I will erect my standard for the isles. And they shall bring thy sons in their bosoms and carry thy daughters on their shoulders:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V23">23&nbsp;</span> and kings shall be thy foster fathers; and their queens thy nursing mothers.

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V24">24&nbsp;</span> Can any one take spoils from a giant? And if any one captivate unjustly shall he be safe.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V25">25&nbsp;</span> For thus saith the Lord, When one captivateth a giant he shall take spoils. But can one take from a mighty man and be safe? But it is I who vindicateth thy cause, and I will deliver thy children.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C49V26">26&nbsp;</span> And they who afflicted thee shall eat their own flesh, and drink like new wine their own blood and be made drunk; and all flesh shall know that it is I the Lord who delivered thee. And who uphold the strength of Israel.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V1">1&nbsp;</span> Lord, who hath believed this report of ours, and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been made manifest?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V2">2&nbsp;</span> We have made proclamation as a child before him: as a root in a thirsty soil, he hath no appearance, nor glory. We have seen him; and he hath neither appearance nor beauty:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V3">3&nbsp;</span> but his appearance is mean and defective beyond the sons of men. Being a man in affliction and acquainted with grief, because his countenance was dejected, he was despised and disesteemed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V4">4&nbsp;</span> This man beareth away our sins; and for us he is in sorrow: And we considered him as being in trouble and under a stroke and in affliction.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V5">5&nbsp;</span> But he was wounded for our sins, and afflicted for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him; by his bruises we are healed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V6">6&nbsp;</span> We all like sheep had strayed; every man wandered in his way: and the Lord delivered him up for our sins:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V7">7&nbsp;</span> and he, on account of his affliction, openeth not his mouth. He was led as a sheep to be slaughtered. And as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V8">8&nbsp;</span> In this humiliation his legal trial was taken away. Who will declare his manner of life. Because his life is taken from the earth; for the transgressions of my people he is led to death;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V9">9&nbsp;</span> therefore for his funeral I will give up the wicked, and the rich for his death. Because he committed no iniquity, nor practised guile with his mouth,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V10">10&nbsp;</span> and the Lord determineth to purify him from this stroke: when his soul shall be given up for a sin offering; of you he shall see a seed which shall prolong their days.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V11">11&nbsp;</span> More over it is the determination of the Lord to remove him from the trouble of his soul; to shew him light and fashion him for knowledge; to justify the Righteous One who is serving many well, when he shall bear away their sins;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C53V12">12&nbsp;</span> therefore he shall inherit many and divide the spoils of the strong. Because his soul was delivered up to death and he was numbered among transgressors and bore away the sins of many and on the account of their iniquities was delivered up;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C54V11">11&nbsp;</span> thou afflicted and storm beaten! Art thou not comforted? Behold I am preparing for thee carbuncles for thy building stones, and the sapphire for thy foundations;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C54V13">13&nbsp;</span> even thy sons, all instructed of God; and thy children in great prosperity.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C54V14">14&nbsp;</span> And with righteousness thou shalt be rebuilded. Abstain from injustice and thou shalt not be affrighted; and as for terror, it shall not approach thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C54V15">15&nbsp;</span> Behold proselytes shall come to thee for my sake; and they shall sojourn with thee and fly to thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C54V16">16&nbsp;</span> Behold I have created thee, not like a coppersmith blowing coals and using a tool for the work. But I have created thee, not for destruction.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C54V17">17&nbsp;</span> Perish every weapon formed against thee! I will not prosper it. Though every voice should rise up against thee for judgment, thou shalt overcome them all and in the trial they shall be condemned. There is an inheritance for them who serve the Lord, therefore you are to be just for me, saith the Lord.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V16">16&nbsp;</span> which shall be blessed on the earth: for they will bless the true God: and they who swear on the earth, will swear by the true God. For they will forget their former affliction and it shall not recur to their mind:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V17">17&nbsp;</span> for there shall be a new heaven and the earth shall be new: and they shall no more remember former things, nor shall they ever come again into their mind.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V18">18&nbsp;</span> But in this they shall find joy and gladness: for behold I am about to make Jerusalem a subject of joy, and this people of mine a subject of rejoicing.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V19">19&nbsp;</span> And I will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in my people; and there shall no more be heard therein, the voice of wailing nor the sound of a mournful cry.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V20">20&nbsp;</span> Nor shall there any more be there an untimely birth, nor an old man, who shall not complete his term. For he who is a hundred years old shall be young; and the sinner, who dieth at a hundred years, shall be deemed accursed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V21">21&nbsp;</span> And they shall build houses and dwell therein: and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V22">22&nbsp;</span> They shall not build, and others inhabit: nor shall they plant and others eat: for according to the days of the tree of that life, shall be the days of this my people: for they shall wear out the works of their toils.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V23">23&nbsp;</span> My chosen ones shall not labour in vain, nor shall they bring forth children for a curse. Because they are a seed blessed of God, both they and their offspring:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V24">24&nbsp;</span> therefore it shall come to pass, that before they call I will answer them: and while they are yet speaking I will say, What is the matter.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C65V25">25&nbsp;</span> Then shall the wolves and the lambs feed together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. But the serpent shall eat dust as bread. They shall not hurt, nor shall they destroy on my holy mountain, saith the Lord.</div>

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">66</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V1">1&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth, my footstool: what sort of an house will you build for me? And of what sort shall be the place of my rest?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V2">2&nbsp;</span> For all these things my hand hath made: and all these things are mine saith the Lord. Upon whom therefore will I look down, but upon him only who is humble and quiet, and who trembleth at my words?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V3">3&nbsp;</span> As for the wicked man, who sacrificeth to me a young bull: he is one who slayeth a dog: and though he offereth me fine flour: it will be as the blood of swine. Though he offereth incense for a memorial, he is as a blasphemer. As they have chosen their own ways: and their soul hath delighted in their abominations:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V4">4&nbsp;</span> I also will chuse their delusions, and pay them back their sins. Because I called them and they did not answer; I spake, but they did not listen: but did that which is evil in my sight, and chose the things in which I did not delight;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V5">5&nbsp;</span> hear the decisions of the Lord; ye who tremble at his word, say, O our brethren; (to them who hate you and are abominable, that the name of the Lord may be glorified and appear to their joy, when they shall be ashamed)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V6">6&nbsp;</span> a sound of screaming from the city! a sound from the temple! the voice of the Lord rendering a recompense to his adversaries!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V7">7&nbsp;</span> That a woman hath brought forth before she travailed; that before her pangs came on, they are over and a male child born;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V8">8&nbsp;</span> who hath heard such a thing, or who hath seen the like? Did ever the earth bring forth in a day, or was ever a nation born at once? That Sion should travail and bring forth her children,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V9">9&nbsp;</span> I myself gave this expectation; yet thou didst not remember me, saith the Lord. Behold did I not make her who beareth; and her who is barren? Said thy God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V10">10&nbsp;</span> Rejoice Jerusalem! and sing praises therein, all ye who love her! Be exceedingly joyful with her, all ye who mourn for her!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V11">11&nbsp;</span> That you may suck and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation; that you may suck and be fed deliciously, at the commencement of her glory.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V12">12&nbsp;</span> For thus saith the Lord, Behold I will glide to them like a peaceful stream, and like a torrent deluging the glory of nations. Their children shall be carried on shoulders, and shall be dandled on knees.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V13">13&nbsp;</span> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and in Jerusalem you shall find consolation.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V14">14&nbsp;</span> And you shall see it, and your heart shall rejoice; and your bones shall flourish like a green herb. And the hand of the Lord will be made known to them who fear him. And it will terrify them who are disobedient.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V15">15&nbsp;</span> For behold! the Lord will come as a fire, and his chariots as a whirlwind, to execute his vengeance with wrath and his rebuke with flaming fire.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V16">16&nbsp;</span> For with the fire of the Lord all this land shall be tried, and all flesh with his sword. Many shall be the slain of the Lord!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V17">17&nbsp;</span> They who consecrate and purify themselves for the gardens, and they who, in the outer courts, eat swine's flesh, and the abominations and the mouse, shall for this be consumed together, said the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V18">18&nbsp;</span> As I know their works and their reasoning I am coming to gather together all the nations and the tongues, and they shall come and see my glory.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V19">19&nbsp;</span> And I will leave among them a sign, and those of them who escape I will send to the nations; to Tharsis and Phud and Lud and Mosach and to Thobel and Greece and to the far distant isles. They who have not heard my name nor seen my glory; even they shall proclaim my glory among the nations;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V20">20&nbsp;</span> and they shall bring your brethren from all the nations, as a gift for the Lord with horses and chariots, in litters borne by mules with umbrellas over them, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord; as the children of Israel brought up their sacrifices for me with songs of praise to the house of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V21">21&nbsp;</span> And of them I will take priests and Levites, said the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V22">22&nbsp;</span> For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, shall remain in my presence, saith the Lord; so shall your seed and your name be established.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V23">23&nbsp;</span> And it shall be, that month after month and sabbath after sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, in Jerusalem, said the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C66V24">24&nbsp;</span> And they shall go forth, and see the carcasses of those men, who have transgressed against me. For their Worm shall not die and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.</div>
