<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> A word of the Lord came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Joatham and Achaz and Ezekias kings of Juda; with regard to those things which he saw touching Samaria and touching Jerusalem,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> Hear, O peoples, words! and let this land attend and all who are in it And let the Lord, Lord among you be a witness: the Lord from his holy temple.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> For behold the Lord is coming forth from his place; and he will come down and walk on the heights of this land;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> and under him the mountains will tremble, and the vallies shall melt like wax before fire, and be like water rolling down a precipice.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> All this is on account of the impiety of Jacob, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the impiety of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the sin of the house of Juda? Is it not Jerusalem?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore I will make Samaria like a hut of a field and like a plant of a vineyard, and I will drag the stones thereof into a ditch and lay her foundations bare.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> And all her graven images shall be hacked to pieces; and all her earnings shall be burned with fire; and all her idols I will utterly destroy. Because from the earnings of fornication she collected, and from the earnings of fornication, amassed;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> therefore she shall wail and utter lamentations: she shall walk barefoot and naked; she shall utter a wailing like that of jackals; and moanings like the daughters of the ostrich.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> Because her wound is large; because it hath come even to Juda and reached the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> magnify not yourselves ye men of Gath, and ye Enakims, rebuild not from a house, in derision. According to your derision you shall sprinkle yourselves with dust.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> Sennaar, who dwelt at ease in her cities, went not forth to bewail a neighbouring house; from you she shall receive a painful wound.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> Who led the way to good for her who was dwelling in sorrows, because evils from the Lord, a sound of chariots and horsemen came down against the gates of Jerusalem?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> Was it the inhabitant of Lachis? She is a leader to sin for the daughter of Sion. Because in thee have been found the impieties of Israel,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> therefore even to the inheritance of Gath he will give up idolatrous houses as abandoned. To the kings of Israel they were of no avail.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> inhabitant of Lachis! until the true heirs shall be brought in; O! Odollam! until an inheritance, the glory of the daughter of Israel shall come,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> shave thy locks and make thyself bald for thy delicate children; lengthen out thy widowhood like an eagle, for they shall be carried from thee into captivity.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> They planned mischief; they contrived evils on their beds, and soon as it was day they executed them; for they did not lift up their hands to God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> They coveted fields and plundered orphans and tyrannised over houses; they plundered a man and his household; a man and his inheritance;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold against this tribe I am planning evils, from which you shall not withdraw your necks, nor walk erect suddenly. Because it is an evil time,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> a parable will in that day be taken up against you, and a song of lamentation will be sung, saying, With affliction we have been afflicted! the portion of my people hath been measured with a line, and there was none to hinder or turn it aside. Your fields have been parcelled out,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> therefore there shall be none to stretch a line for thee by lot, in the congregation of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> Weep not bitterly, nor let tears be shed for these things, for reproaches will not be cast off even by him who saith,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> The house of Israel hath provoked to wrath the spirit of the Lord. Are not these his purposes? Are not his words good with him? Have these walked in a straight course?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> Indeed this people of mine have openly risen up for enmity. In direct opposition to his peace they have even stripped off his skin, that the extreme horror of war might destroy hope.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> The leaders of my people shall be hurled from their houses of pleasure; for their wicked devices they have been expelled; draw ye near to the everlasting mountains.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> Arise and depart, for this is not a rest for thee. By reason of impurity you are utterly corrupted:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> you have been put to flight when there was no pursuer: a spirit hath set up a lie: it hath dropped on thee for wine and plenty. Yet it shall come to pass that from a drop of this people,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> Jacob with all his sons shall be gathered together. With expectation I will expect the remnant of Israel. I will place together them who are about to return. Like sheep in distress, like a flock in their fold, they shall rush out from among men through a breach before them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> They have broken through and passed the gate; they are gone through it and their king is gone out before them; and the Lord will be their leader,</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V1">1&nbsp;</span> and he will say, Hear these things ye children of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel, is it not your business to know judgment?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> As for them who hate good and seek evil, who tear off the skin from these and the flesh from their bones:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> as they have devoured the flesh of my people and have flayed off their skin from them; and have broken their bones and chopped them up, as flesh for a kettle and as pieces of meat for a pot:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> so they shall cry to the Lord but he will not hearken to them; but will turn away his face from them at that time, because by their devices they have committed evil against these.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> Thus saith the Lord against the prophets who led my people astray, who gnash with their teeth and proclaim peace for them, though it was not put in their mouths; they have raised up war against them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore from vision you shall have night; and from prophesying you shall have darkness. And the sun shall set upon the prophets, and upon them the day shall darken:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V7">7&nbsp;</span> and the seers of dreams shall be put to shame; and the diviners shall be laughed to scorn, and reviled by all; for none will hearken to them.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> None but I can, by the spirit of the Lord, supply strength both of judgment and might to declare to Jacob his impiety and to Israel his sins.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V11">11&nbsp;</span> Her rulers have judged for rewards; and her priests have given answers for hire; and her prophets have prophesied for silver, without waiting for the Lord, saying, Is not the Lord among us? No evils shall come upon us:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V12">12&nbsp;</span> therefore because of you, Sion shall be ploughed like a field; and Jerusalem shall be like a temporary building for summer fruits; and the mountain of the house shall be for a grove of a forest.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> But it shall come to pass in the last of these days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be conspicuous: it shall be established on the tops of the mountains, and raised high above the hills; and peoples shall hasten to it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> And many nations shall come; they will say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; that they may point out to us his ways, and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Sion shall go forth a law; and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> And he will judge among many peoples, and rebuke nations of extensive power. And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall no more lift up a sword against nation; nor shall they any more learn to fight.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> But they shall rest every man under his own vine, and every man under his own fig tree; and there shall be none to make them afraid. Because the mouth of the Lord Almighty hath spoken these things:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> because all the people will walk every one in his own way, let us therefore walk in the name of the Lord our God until that age and beyond it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather her that hath been bruised; and take back her who was cast off and them whom I had put away:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> and I will make the bruised a remnant, and her who was put away, a mighty nation. And the Lord will reign over them on mount Sion henceforth and forever.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V8">8&nbsp;</span> And as for thee, thou squalid tower of a flock, thou daughter of Sion; to thee he will come, when the chiefdom, the first royal government shall have come from Babylon for the daughter of Jerusalem.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> Now therefore why hast thou known evils? Was there no king for thee? Or was thy counsel destroyed, that pangs of a woman in travail have seized thee?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V10">10&nbsp;</span> Be in pangs, but take courage and draw near to delivery, daughter of Sion. For thou art now to go from a city and to make thy abode in a field, and go even to Babylon. Thence he will deliver thee; yes, thence the Lord thy God will redeem thee out of the hands of thine enemies.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> Now indeed many nations are assembled against thee, saying, Let us rejoice exceedingly and let our eyes look upon Sion.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V12">12&nbsp;</span> But they did not know the determination of the Lord nor understand his counsel. Because he hath gathered them as sheaves for a threshing floor,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V13">13&nbsp;</span> arise daughter of Sion and tread them out. Because I will make thy horns iron and thy hoofs I will make brass; therefore thou shalt break many peoples in pieces, and devote the multitude of them to the Lord, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V13">13&nbsp;</span> And the land shall be for desolation with them who inhabit it, for the fruits of their devices.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V14">14&nbsp;</span> Feed thou thy people with thy crook; the flock of thy heritage; them who are by themselves in a forest in the midst of yonder Carmel. They shall feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V15">15&nbsp;</span> And as in the days of thy coming out of Egypt, you shall see wonderful things.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V16">16&nbsp;</span> Nations shall see and be confounded, and because of all the mighty power of these, they will lay their hands on their mouths. Their ears will be stopped.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V17">17&nbsp;</span> They will lick dust like serpents trailing on the ground; they will be confounded in their enclosure. At the Lord our God let them be confounded and struck with terror because of thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V18">18&nbsp;</span> Who is a God like unto thee, taking away iniquities, and passing by the transgressions of the remnant of his heritage? He hath not kept his anger in remembrance; because he delighteth in mercy;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V19">19&nbsp;</span> he will turn and have compassion on us: he will bury deep our iniquities: they shall be whelmed in the depths of the sea.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C7V20">20&nbsp;</span> All our sins he will give up for truth to Jacob, as an act of mercy to Abraham as he sware to our fathers, according to the days which have been heretofore.</div>
