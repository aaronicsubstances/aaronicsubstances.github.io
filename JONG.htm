<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> When a word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> Arise and go to Ninive that great city and proclaim in it, That the cry of its wickedness is come up to me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> Jonas arose to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa, and finding a ship bound to Tharsis, he paid his fare and went on board with a design to sail with them to Tharsis, from the presence of the Lord.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> But the Lord raised a wind on the sea, and there was a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was in danger of foundering.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> And the mariners were terrified, and cried every one to his god, and threw overboard some of the cargo, to lighten the vessel. Now Jonas had gone down into the ship's hold, and was asleep and snoring.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> And the master of the ship came to him and said to him, What! art thou snoring? Arise and call on thy God, that thy God may save us, and that we may not perish.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> Then they said, one to another, Come let us cast lots and know on whose account this calamity is come on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> Whereupon they said to him, Tell us. What is thy business? And whence comest thou? And of what country, and of what people art thou?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> And he said to them, I am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> Upon this the men were greatly terrified and said to him, Why hast thou done this? (For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, for he had told them.)</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> Then they said to him, What shall we do to thee that the sea may be calmed for us? For the sea rolled and grew more and more tempestuous.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> And Jonas said to them, Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you; for I know that on my account this great tempest is come upon you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> When the men had laboured hard to reach land, but could not because the sea ran high, and grew more tempestuous against them,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> then they cried to the Lord and said, Forbid it, Lord, that we perish, for the life of this man, and bring not upon us innocent blood; for thou, Lord, hast done according to thy pleasure.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> Then they took Jonas and cast him into the sea. Whereupon from raging the sea became still.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> Now the Lord had commanded a great fish to swallow Jonas, so Jonas was three days and three nights, in the belly of the fish.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> And when out of the belly of the great fish, Jonas prayed to the Lord his God,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> and said, In my affliction I cried to the Lord my God, and he hearkened to me: thou didst hear my cry from the womb of Hades: thou didst hearken to my prayer:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> thou hast cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea. When streams encompassed me; all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> Then I said, I am cast out from thy sight; nevertheless I will continue to look towards thy holy temple.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> The water was poured around me to my soul; and the lowest abyss encompassed me; my head hath gone down into the clefts of mountains;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> I have gone down to a land, the bars of which are everlastingly fixed: let my soul now, corrupted as it is, ascend, Lord, my God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> When my soul was fainting I remembered the Lord; let my prayer now come to thee into thy holy temple.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> They who worship vanities and lies have forsaken their mercy:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise and thanksgiving. I will pay thee what I have vowed to the Lord for my deliverance.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> Upon this a command was given by the Lord to the fish, and it cast forth Jonas upon the dry ground.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V1">1&nbsp;</span> Then a word of the Lord came to Jonas a second time saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> Arise and go to Ninive that great city, and proclaim in it according to the former proclamation which I spoke to thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> So Jonas arose and went to Ninive as the Lord had spoken. Now Ninive was an exceeding great city, of about three days' journey.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> And Jonas began at his entering the city, and for about one day's journey cried with a loud voice and said, Yet three days and Ninive shall be destroyed?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> And the men of Ninive believed God and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> When the word reached the king of Ninive, he arose from his throne and stripped off his robes and clothed himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V7">7&nbsp;</span> And proclamation was made and orders issued in Ninive from the king and from his nobles, saying, With regard to men and beasts, including herds and flocks, Let them not taste any thing; let them neither feed nor drink water.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> So both men and beasts were covered with sackcloth; and there was an incessant cry to God; and every one turned from his evil way, and from the wickedness of their hands, saying,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V9">9&nbsp;</span> Who knoweth but God will relent and turn away from his fierce wrath, so that we may not perish.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V10">10&nbsp;</span> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways. And God relented at the evil which he said he would do to them, and did it not.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V1">1&nbsp;</span> Thereupon Jonas was exceedingly grieved and confounded,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V2">2&nbsp;</span> and he prayed to the Lord and said, Lord were not these my words, when I was yet in my own country? For which cause I attempted to flee to Tharsis. For I knew that thou art compassionate and merciful, long suffering and abundant in kindness and relentest at evils.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V3">3&nbsp;</span> Now, therefore, Sovereign Lord, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V4">4&nbsp;</span> And the Lord said to Jonas, Art thou very sorry?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V5">5&nbsp;</span> (Now Jonas had gone out of the city and sat over against it, and had made for himself a booth and sat under it until he should see what would befal the city.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V6">6&nbsp;</span> And the Lord had given orders to a colocynthis, and it had sprung up over the head of Jonas to be a shade over his head to shade him on account of his sufferings; and Jonas was exceeding glad of the colocynthis.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V7">7&nbsp;</span> But early the next morning God gave orders to a Worm and it smote the colocynthis and it withered.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V8">8&nbsp;</span> And when the sun rose God ordered a burning wind to spring up and the sun beat upon Jonas' head so that he became fainty and abandoned himself to despair and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V9">9&nbsp;</span> And God said to Jonas, Art thou very sorry) for the colocynthis. And he said I am sorry even to death.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V10">10&nbsp;</span> Thereupon the Lord said, Thou hast compassion for the colocynthis, for which thou hast not toiled and which thou hast not nourished, which sprang up in a night and perished in a night.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C4V11">11&nbsp;</span> And shall not I have compassion on Ninive this great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand of the human species, who know not their right hand and their left; and also much cattle.</div>
