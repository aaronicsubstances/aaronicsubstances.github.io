<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> Yet still they went on sinning against Him;</div>
<div class="q2">they provoked the Most High in the desert.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> And they tempted God in their hearts</div>
<div class="q2">by demanding food for their cravings.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span> And they spoke against God and said:</div>

<div class="q2">but can He also give us bread,</div>

<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> So the Lord heard and deferred,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">He deferred giving them the promised food and the Promised Land.</span></a></div>
<div class="q2">and a fire was kindled in Jacob,</div>
<div class="q2">and wrath mounted against Israel,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> because they did not believe in God</div>
<div class="q2">or trust in His salvation.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span> Then He commanded the clouds above,</div>
<div class="q2">and opened the doors of heaven,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> and rained upon them manna to eat,</div>
<div class="q2">and gave them the bread of heaven.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> Man ate the bread of Angels;</div>
<div class="q2">He sent them food in abundance.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> He banished the south wind from heaven,</div>
<div class="q2">and by His power He brought in a southwest wind.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> And He rained flesh on them as thick as dust</div>
<div class="q2">and winged birds like the sand of the seas.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> And the birds fell in the midst of their camp,</div>
<div class="q2">all round their tents.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> So they ate and were thoroughly stuffed,</div>
<div class="q2">and He brought them their desire.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> They had not stayed their desire</div>
<div class="q2">and the food was still in their mouths</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> when the wrath of God rose against them</div>
<div class="q2">and slew the strongest of them.</div>
<div class="q2">and laid low the picked men of Israel.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> Yet for all this they still sinned,</div>
<div class="q2">and did not believe in His wonders.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span> Their days slipped by in vanity,</div>
<div class="q2">and their years in anxiety.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span> When He slew them, then they sought Him,</div>
<div class="q2">and returned and rose to seek God early,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span> and they remembered that God was their helper</div>
<div class="q2">and that the Most High was their redeemer.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span> Then they loved Him with their mouth,</div>
<div class="q2">and with their tongue they lied to Him.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span> Their heart was not right with Him,</div>
<div class="q2">and they were not faithful to His covenant.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span> Yet He Who is compassionate</div>
<div class="q2">forgave their sins and did not destroy them;</div>
<div class="q2">again and again He averted His anger</div>
<div class="q2">and did not let His wrath consume them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span> He remembered that they were flesh,</div>
<div class="q2">a spirit that passes and never returns.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span> How often they provoked Him in the wilderness</div>
<div class="q2">and grieved Him in the desert!</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span> They turned back and tempted God,</div>
<div class="q2">and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span> They did not remember His hand,</div>
<div class="q2">or the day when He redeemed them</div>
<div class="q2">from the hand of the oppressor,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span> how He wrought His signs in Egypt,</div>
<div class="q2">and His wonders in the field of Tanis,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span> and turned into blood their rivers and rain-water,</div>
<div class="q2">so that they could not drink.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span> He sent them the dog-fly and it devoured them,</div>
<div class="q2">and the frog and it destroyed them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span> And He gave their crops to the mildew,</div>
<div class="q2">and the fruit of their labors to the locust.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span> He killed their vines with hail,</div>
<div class="q2">and their mulberry trees with frost.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span> And He gave up their cattle to the hail,</div>
<div class="q2">and their produce to the fire.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span> He sent upon them His furious wrath,</div>
<div class="q2">fury and wrath and trouble,</div>
<div class="q2">a visitation of evil angels.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span> He gave free range to His wrath,</div>
<div class="q2">He spared not their lives from death</div>
<div class="q2">and to death consigned their cattle.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span> And He struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt,</div>
<div class="q2">all their labor’s first-fruits in the homesteads of Ham,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span> Then He removed His people like a herd of sheep,</div>
<div class="q2">and led them like a flock in the wilderness.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span> And He guided them with hope so they were not afraid,</div>
<div class="q2">while the sea closed over their enemies.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span> And He brought them to His mountain sanctuary,</div>
<div class="q2">to this mountain which His right hand acquired.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span> And He drove out nations from before them,</div>
<div class="q2">and gave each his share of land by lot</div>
<div class="q2">and settled the tribes of Israel in their homesteads.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the Most High God,</div>
<div class="q2">and did not keep His testimonies.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span> They turned away and broke faith like their fathers,</div>
<div class="q2">they twisted like a crooked bow.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span> They provoked Him with their high places</div>
<div class="q2">and defied Him with their carved images.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span> God heard of it and disdained them,</div>
<div class="q2">and utterly rejected Israel.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span> And He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,</div>
<div class="q2">His tent where He dwelt among men.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span> And He delivered their strength into captivity,</div>
<div class="q2">and their beauty into the power of their enemies.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span> And He consigned His people to the sword,</div>
<div class="q2">and despised His inheritance.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span> Fire consumed their young men,</div>
<div class="q2">and their virgins raised no lament.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span> Their priests fell by the sword,</div>
<div class="q2">and their widows sang no dirge.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span> Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep,</div>
<div class="q2">like a warrior recovered from wine.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span> And He struck His enemies in the rear:</div>
<div class="q2">He branded them with eternal disgrace.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span> And He rejected the dwelling of Joseph,</div>
<div class="q2">and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span> But He chose the tribe of Judah,</div>
<div class="q2">Mount Zion which He loved.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V69">69&nbsp;</span> And He built His sanctuary like the horn of a rhinoceros;<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">‘The rhinoceros is an invincible animal, because it has on its forehead a sharp horn with which it kills every beast.

<div class="q2">He established it in the land for ever.</div>
