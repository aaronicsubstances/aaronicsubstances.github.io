Of your infinite mercies, you have appointed repentance to sinners, that they may be saved. You therefore, O Lord, who are the God of the just, have not appointed repentance to the just, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against you, but you have appointed repentance to me, a sinner.  <span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&#160;</span>For I have sinned more than the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied,<a href="#C1FN2" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> The Alex.

MS. omits I did... commandments.</span></a> I didn’t do your will, neither did I keep your commandments. I have set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable things.  <span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&#160;</span>Now therefore I bow the knee of my heart, asking you for grace.  <span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&#160;</span>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge my iniquities;  <span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&#160;</span>but, I humbly ask you, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and please don’t destroy me with my iniquities. Don’t be angry with me forever, by reserving evil for me. Don’t condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent.  <span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&#160;</span>In me you will show all your goodness, for you will save me, even though I am unworthy, according to your great mercy.  <span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&#160;</span>Then I will praise you forever all the days of my life; for all the army of heaven sings your praise, and yours is the glory forever and ever.
