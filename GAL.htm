Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&#160;</span>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,  <span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&#160;</span>but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&#160;</span>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.  <span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&#160;</span>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&#160;</span>For am I now seeking the favour of men, or of God?

Then I returned to Damascus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&#160;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.  <span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&#160;</span>But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.  <span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&#160;</span>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<a href="#C1FN3" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
