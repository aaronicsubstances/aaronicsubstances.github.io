<div class="mt">THE PROVERBS OF SOLOMON</div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0">1</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V1">1&nbsp;</span> The Proverbs of David's son Solomon, who reigned over Israel,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V2">2&nbsp;</span> to give a knowledge of wisdom and instruction; the perception of the words of prudence;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V3">3&nbsp;</span> the interpretation of sentences; a discernment of true justice; and to direct judgment,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V4">4&nbsp;</span> that he might give sagacity to the innocent; and to the youth knowledge and discretion:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V5">5&nbsp;</span> for by attending to them a wise man will become wiser; and a man of understanding will possess a rule of government</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V6">6&nbsp;</span> and will understand a proverb and dark speech and the sayings of the wise and parables.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V7">7&nbsp;</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And all who practise this have good understanding. And piety towards God is the beginning of discernment: but the wicked despise wisdom and instruction.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V8">8&nbsp;</span> My son, hear the instruction of thy father and reject not the maxims of thy mother:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V9">9&nbsp;</span> for thou wilt receive a graceful crown for thy head; and a chain of gold for thy neck.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V10">10&nbsp;</span> My son, let not wicked men lead thee astray. Consent not when they advise thee,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V11">11&nbsp;</span> saying, Come with us; partake of blood; and let us hide in the earth an innocent man without cause,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V12">12&nbsp;</span> and swallow him up alive, as the grave, and take away from earth the remembrance of him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V13">13&nbsp;</span> Let us seize his precious substance and fill our houses with spoils.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V14">14&nbsp;</span> Cast in thy lot among us, and let us all have a common purse. Let one scrip serve us.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V15">15&nbsp;</span> Go not thou in the way with them; but turn thy foot from their paths.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V16">16&nbsp;</span> ---</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V17">17&nbsp;</span> For nets are not spread for birds unjustly.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V18">18&nbsp;</span> For they who are accomplices to murder, treasure up evils for themselves. And doleful is the destruction of wicked men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V19">19&nbsp;</span> Such are the ways of all who commit iniquitous deeds. For by wickedness they destroy their own soul.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V20">20&nbsp;</span> Wisdom uttereth her song at the gates and in the streets speaketh boldly;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V21">21&nbsp;</span> and on the tops of walls she maketh proclamation; and at the gates of mighty men taketh a seat and at the gates of a city with confidence saith,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V22">22&nbsp;</span> While the innocent adhere to justice they shall not be put to shame: but as for fools who delight in mischief, having become wicked they hated knowledge and are become liable to censures.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V23">23&nbsp;</span> Behold I will pour forth to you the dictate of my spirit: and teach you this word of mine;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V24">24&nbsp;</span> seeing I have called and you have not answered: and though I continued my speech, you did not attend:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V25">25&nbsp;</span> but set at naught my counsels and disregarded my reproofs:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V26">26&nbsp;</span> therefore I will laugh at your calamity; and mock when your destruction cometh.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V27">27&nbsp;</span> Yes, when tumult shall suddenly come upon you; and destruction like a whirlwind shall be at hand; even when tribulation and siege approach you; or when destruction is advancing upon you.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V28">28&nbsp;</span> For when you call upon me I will not listen to you. The wicked may seek me, but they shall not find me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V29">29&nbsp;</span> For they hated wisdom and did not chuse the word of the Lord:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V30">30&nbsp;</span> nor would they attend to my counsels, but contemned my reproofs:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V31">31&nbsp;</span> Let them eat, therefore, the fruits of their own way; and be filled with their own iniquity.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V32">32&nbsp;</span> For, because they wronged infants they shall be slain: and a rigorous inquest shall destroy the wicked.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C1V33">33&nbsp;</span> But he who hearkeneth to me shall dwell with hope; and rest secure from all evil.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V1">1&nbsp;</span> My son, if thou wilt receive the dictate which I enjoin and hide it with thee,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V2">2&nbsp;</span> thine ear will hearken to wisdom; and thou wilt apply thy heart to understanding, and transmit it for instruction to thy son.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V3">3&nbsp;</span> For if thou wilt call upon wisdom: and utter thy voice for understanding;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V4">4&nbsp;</span> if thou wilt seek for it as silver; and search for it as for treasures;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V5">5&nbsp;</span> then thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord; and find the knowledge of God.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V6">6&nbsp;</span> For the Lord giveth wisdom; and from his presence is knowledge and understanding:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V7">7&nbsp;</span> and he treasureth up salvation for the upright. He will protect their going,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V8">8&nbsp;</span> that they may keep the paths of rectitude. And he will guard the way of them who reverence him.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V9">9&nbsp;</span> Then thou shalt understand judgment and justice; and direct all thy wheels right.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V10">10&nbsp;</span> For when wisdom entereth into thine understanding: and knowledge appeareth pleasant to thy soul:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V11">11&nbsp;</span> good counsel will keep thee, and holy prudence will guard thee:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V12">12&nbsp;</span> that she may deliver thee from an evil way and from a man who speaketh perversely.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V13">13&nbsp;</span> Alas for them who leave straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V14">14&nbsp;</span> who are delighted with evils and have joy in evil perversion;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V15">15&nbsp;</span> whose ways are crooked, and whose paths turn aside to lead thee far from the straight road</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V16">16&nbsp;</span> and estrange thee from a just determination.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V17">17&nbsp;</span> My son, let not evil counsel, who hath forsaken the discipline of youth and hath forgotten the divine covenant, take hold of thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V18">18&nbsp;</span> For she hath placed her house near death; and her wheels with the earth born near the mansion of the dead.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V19">19&nbsp;</span> None who walk by her direction can ever return; nor ever recover the right paths.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V20">20&nbsp;</span> For they are not taken hold of by years of life. If they indeed had walked in good ways: they would have found the paths of justice smooth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V21">21&nbsp;</span> Because the upright shall inhabit the land; and the holy shall be left in it;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C2V22">22&nbsp;</span> the ways of the wicked shall be destroyed from the land; and the transgressors shall be driven out of it.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V2">2&nbsp;</span> For they will add to thee length of days and years of life and peace.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V3">3&nbsp;</span> Let not acts of kindness and faithfulness forsake thee: but bind them about thy neck</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V4">4&nbsp;</span> and thou shalt find favour. Be provident in regard to things good in the sight of the Lord and of men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V5">5&nbsp;</span> Trust in God with thy whole heart; and be not elated for thine own wisdom.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V6">6&nbsp;</span> Shew it in all thy ways, that it may make thy paths straight.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V7">7&nbsp;</span> Be not wise in thine own conceit; but fear God and depart from all evil:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V8">8&nbsp;</span> then shall thy body have health and thy bones a cure.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V9">9&nbsp;</span> Honour the Lord with some of thy righteous labours: and set apart for him some of thy fruits of righteousness:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V10">10&nbsp;</span> that thy barns may be plenteously filled with corn; and that thy vats may overflow with wine.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V11">11&nbsp;</span> My son, slight not the correction of the Lord; nor faint when reproved by him:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V12">12&nbsp;</span> for whom the Lord loveth he reproveth: and chastiseth every son whom he receiveth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V13">13&nbsp;</span> Happy the man, who hath found wisdom: and the mortal who hath seen prudence:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V14">14&nbsp;</span> for it is better to traffick for her, than for treasures of gold and silver.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V15">15&nbsp;</span> She is more precious than costly stones: and nothing evil can be compared to her. She is easily known by all who approach her; but no price is equal to her in value.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V16">16&nbsp;</span> For length of days and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left, riches and glory. Out of her mouth proceedeth righteousness: and on her tongue she carrieth law and mercy.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V17">17&nbsp;</span> Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V18">18&nbsp;</span> She is a tree of life to all who take hold of her; and safe for them who rely on her, as on the Lord.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V20">20&nbsp;</span> By knowledge the deeps were broken up and the clouds distilled dew.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V21">21&nbsp;</span> My son, be not wanting in retention: but keep my counsel, namely, the sentiment:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V22">22&nbsp;</span> that thy soul may live and that grace may be around thy neck: and it will be health to thy flesh and a cure for thy bones;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V23">23&nbsp;</span> that thou mayst proceed on in all thy ways in peace and security; and that thy foot may not stumble.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V26">26&nbsp;</span> For the Lord will be over all thy ways, and will support thy foot that thou mayst not be shaken.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V28">28&nbsp;</span> Do not say, Go away and come again: tomorrow I will give; when thou hast it in thy power to do good: for thou knowest not what to-morrow will bring forth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V29">29&nbsp;</span> Devise not evils against thy friend; who sojourneth with thee and confideth in thee.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V31">31&nbsp;</span> Acquire not the reproaches of bad men, nor be fond of their ways.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V32">32&nbsp;</span> For every transgressor is impure in the sight of the Lord; and among the righteous he taketh not a seat.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V33">33&nbsp;</span> The curse of God is in the houses of the wicked: but the folds of the righteous are blessed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C3V34">34&nbsp;</span> The Lord resisteth the proud; but he granteth favour to the humble.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C5V2">2&nbsp;</span> that thou mayst keep a good understanding. Now the sense of my lips giveth thee this injunction; listen not to an abandoned woman;</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V1">1&nbsp;</span> My son, if thou become surety for thy friend, thou wilt deliver up thy hand to an enemy.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V2">2&nbsp;</span> For a man's own lips are a powerful snare, and he is caught by the words of his own mouth.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V3">3&nbsp;</span> Do, my son, what I enjoin thee, and save thyself; for thou art come into the hands of bad men on thy friend's account. Be not remiss, but importune thy friend for whom thou art surety.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V4">4&nbsp;</span> Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V5">5&nbsp;</span> that thou mayst be saved like a roe from a toil, and like a bird from a snare.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V6">6&nbsp;</span> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; and having seen its ways follow the example and be wiser than it.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V7">7&nbsp;</span> For having no cultivated field, no driver, nor master,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V8">8&nbsp;</span> it provideth its food in summer, and layeth up a plentiful supply in harvest. Or go to the bee and learn what a Worker she is: and how seriously she performeth her work, to the labours of which both kings and subjects apply themselves as far as health permits; and to all it is agreeable and honourable. And though her strength be small, having honoured wisdom she is diligently employed.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V9">9&nbsp;</span> How long wilt thou sleep, sluggard, and when wilt thou rouse from sleep?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V10">10&nbsp;</span> Thou art sleeping a little; but resting a little; but taking a short nap; but folding thy hands a little while on thy breast!</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V11">11&nbsp;</span> But is not poverty coming upon thee like an unwelcome traveller? And want like a speedy courier? Whereas if thou be diligent; thy harvest will come like a fountain, and want like a bad courier will run away.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V12">12&nbsp;</span> A man void of understanding, and a transgressor, walketh in ways which are not good.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V13">13&nbsp;</span> But he winketh with his eye and maketh a sign with his foot; and teacheth, by pointing his fingers;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V14">14&nbsp;</span> his depraved heart contriveth mischief. Such a one is continually raising tumults in a city.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V15">15&nbsp;</span> For this cause his destruction cometh suddenly; wounds and incurable bruises.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V16">16&nbsp;</span> Because he delighteth in all those things which God hateth: therefore he is destroyed for the depravity of his soul.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V17">17&nbsp;</span> His eye is that of a scorner; his tongue is false; his hands are employed in shedding innocent blood;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V18">18&nbsp;</span> his heart contriveth wicked purposes, and his feet are swift to do evil:</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V19">19&nbsp;</span> as a false witness he spreadeth lies, and soweth discord among brethren.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V20">20&nbsp;</span> My son, keep the laws of thy father, and reject not the maxims of thy mother.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V21">21&nbsp;</span> Bind them continually on thy mind: and tie them as a chain around thy neck.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V22">22&nbsp;</span> When thou walkest, take this along and let it be with thee: and when thou sleepest, let it guard thee; that when thou awakest, it may talk with thee.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V23">23&nbsp;</span> For the command of a law is a lamp and light; and reproof and instruction is the way of life,</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V24">24&nbsp;</span> to keep thee from a married woman; and from the flattering tongue of a strange woman.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V25">25&nbsp;</span> Let not a lust for beauty overcome thee: be not captivated by thine eyes, nor ensnared by her eyelids.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V26">26&nbsp;</span> For the price of a harlot is scarce that of a single loaf; but an adulteress hunteth for the precious lives of men.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V27">27&nbsp;</span> Can any one put fire in his bosom and not burn his clothes?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V28">28&nbsp;</span> Or can one walk on coals of fire and not burn his feet?</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V29">29&nbsp;</span> So he who goeth in, to a married woman, cannot escape punishment; no, nor any one who toucheth her.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V30">30&nbsp;</span> It exciteth no wonder, if one be caught stealing; for a hungry man stealeth to satisfy his soul;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V31">31&nbsp;</span> but if he be caught, he is to pay seven fold; and by giving all that he hath, he will deliver himself.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V32">32&nbsp;</span> But he, who through want of understanding, committeth adultery, provideth destruction for his soul.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V33">33&nbsp;</span> He suffereth pangs and dishonour; and his reproach can never be wiped away.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V34">34&nbsp;</span> For the rage of her husband being full of jealousy, will not spare in the day of vengeance;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C6V35">35&nbsp;</span> nor will he abate his enmity for any ransom; nor be appeased by many gifts.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V9">9&nbsp;</span> Death meeteth the uninstructed and a fool dieth by sins.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V10">10&nbsp;</span> In a man who is self willed, arrogant and boastful there is impurity: in an evil day and a day of adversity, he will be stained deeper and deeper, until he utterly faint.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V11">11&nbsp;</span> Deliver them who are to be led away to death; and intercede for them who are to be slain, make no delay.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V13">13&nbsp;</span> My son, eat honey (for a honey comb is good) that thy palate may be sweetened.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V22">22&nbsp;</span> For they can suddenly punish the wicked; and their punishments who can know? A son who keepeth the word shall be far from destruction; for he hath received it to effect. Let no falsehood be uttered from the mouth of a king, and from his mouth let no falsehood proceed. The tongue of a king is a sword and not flesh; whoever is delivered up to it shall be destroyed. For if his wrath be sharpened, it consumeth men with thongs, and devoureth the bones of men; or like a flame, burneth them up, so that they cannot be devoured by young eagles. My son, be awed by these words of mine, receive them and reform.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V28">28&nbsp;</span> Be not a false witness against thy fellow citizen, nor give a loose to thy lips.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V29">29&nbsp;</span> Do not say, I will use him as he hath used me; and punish him for the injuries he hath done me.</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V30">30&nbsp;</span> A fool is like a field, and a man void of understanding, like a vineyard;</div>
<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V31">31&nbsp;</span> if thou lettest them alone, they will be overrun with weeds and grass, and become useless, and their stone fences will be thrown down.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C24V33">33&nbsp;</span> I am dozing a little: just taking a short nap; just infolding my breast with my hands.</div>

<div class="m"><span class="verse" id="C25V10">10&nbsp;</span> lest thy friend upbraid thee: in which case thy quarrel and enmity will not cease, but last till death.
