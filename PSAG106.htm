<div class="q2">whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span> whom He has gathered out of the lands,</div>

<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> They wandered in the wilderness, in a waterless land;</div>
<div class="q2">they could find no way to a city to settle in.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> Hungry and thirsty,</div>
<div class="q2">their soul fainted within them.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,</div>
<div class="q2">and He delivered them from their distress.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> And He guided them to the right way,</div>
<div class="q2">till they came to a city where they could settle.</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> Let them praise and thank the Lord for His mercies</div>
<div class="q2">and His wonders for the children of men.</div>

<div class="q2">bound by poverty and iron,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> because they rebelled against God’s decrees,</div>
<div class="q2">and thwarted the will of the Most High,</div>
<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> when their heart was humbled by troubles,</div>
<div class="q2">when they were weak and there was no one to help them,</div>

<div class="q"><span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span> He helped them out of the way of their sin,</div>
<div class="q2">for they were brought low through their iniquities.</div>
